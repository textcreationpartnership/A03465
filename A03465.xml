            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reuerend and right worſhipfull, <hi>Richard Neyle</hi> Doctour of Diuinitie, Deane of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, and Principall Clarke of the Kings moſt Excellent Maieſtie his Cloſet, all proſperitie, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong other accidents of this mortall life (right graue, worthy and learned Doctour) this is one, to build and not to inhabite, to plow and not to ſee the harueſt, to purpoſe and not to attaine the end of our deſignes, to write and compile bookes and ſtudies, and not to liue to publiſh them. So hath it beene with Lawyers, Phiſitions, Philoſophers, Linguiſts &amp; Diuines, &amp; among other in late times, with that moſt learned man <hi>Chemnitius</hi> a German Diuine, who after he had vndertaken that worthy work of the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the foure Goſpels, which by the opinion of one of our graueſt &amp; learnedeſt Diuines, Doctour <hi>Whitaker</hi> was called <hi>Caput veneris.</hi> For that (in his iudgement) hee hauing but entered to ſpeak and write of the head of the Goſpels, namely, Chriſts incarnation &amp; ſome few miracles and ſermons, laid vnmatchable grounds, as it were the colours that none could imitate, afterward before the worke was one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performed, to the great loſſe, not onely of the learned, but of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was taken out of the miſeries of this preſent world. Among Engliſh Diuines (that I may not preſſe you with any vnneceſſary relations, becauſe you loue ſinglenes and plainneſſe) it was alſo the lot of as godly &amp; diſcreete a preacher as any I euer knew in my daies, to draw his laſt breath before he could effect to his content, the publication of ſundry his experimentall works &amp; obſeruations, about afflicted conſciences and troubled or contrite minds, I meane maſter <hi>Greenham.</hi> But as God would not giue the Land of promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to his ſeed and children, and as <hi>Moſes</hi> might not enter into Canaan, but ſee it a far off: ſo it fared with theſe men, they ſaw their wiſhed deſires, like <hi>Palinurus</hi> watching and waiting the returne of his ſhips, although they dyed before their perfection, and therefore their names are their heires, and God ſtirred vp learned men to ſet forth to the world their intended, learned and godly labours, for <hi>Lycerus</hi> publiſhed <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> &amp; maſter <hi>Holland</hi> a preacher late of S. <hi>Brides</hi> in London, did the like for maſter <hi>Greenham.</hi> Now all things haue their courſe and reuolution. <hi>Iron ſharpeneth iron, ſo doth man ſharpen the face of his friend. He that keepeth the fig-tree ſhall eate of the fruit thereof, and he that waiteth vpon his maſter ſhall come to honour. As in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter face anſwereth face, ſo the heart of man to man. Pro. 27.17.18.19.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4351:3"/> That is, they prouided for themſelues which thus regarded other men, &amp; as <hi>Rahab</hi> by entertaining the ſpies of Iſraell, deſerued to bee regarded by Iſraell at the ſacking of Iericho, ſo haue theſe men, to haue the like done for them, that they did for other.</p>
            <p>There came vnto my hands about halfe a yeere paſt, a treatiſe or coppy bearing title, The foure-fold ſtate of <hi>Adam,</hi> compiled by maſter <hi>Holland</hi> aforeſaid, and allowed by authoritie to be printed. But it ſeemed the work wanted the father, (be it ſpoken without offence) for it was not well clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, cowched, or bound vp together; and beſides, of the foure eſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the title, it wanted one. It had paſſed through the veiw of many learned men, euery one approuing that which was done, and none helping to bring it to ſome perfection: at laſt my friend the Printer (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a deſire, firſt, for the glorie of God, and good of the Church: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the releife of the poore widdow and many fatherleſſe children) mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with it, freely vndertooke the charge and aduenture (which cannot be ſmall) to imprint and ſet it forth to the world. But finding no coherence in the matter, nor pleaſant order in the manner, (the margents of the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py being greater, or as great as the booke) was forced to breake off, and leaue that enterpriſe: and ſo offred the ſame to me, praying my help (which God knoweth is weake) to contriue it and bring it into ſuch a faſhion as might be plaine, and intelligible to the Engliſh Reader; I accepted the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at the firſt, not weighing the wants, but thought onely to ſupply in it the place of a Correctour. And therefore reading it, I found many things in the margent which were ordained for the page, and becauſe I found in it a great number of pithy &amp; ſubſtantiall points curiouſly and not vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled (like able ſouldiours wanting a Marſhall, or like the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full limbes of a naked body lacking garments) I ſtrained my ſelfe, for the honour of God and my loue to the dead, both to marſhall all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his meaning (ſo neare as I could) and alſo to put vpon his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Orphan, ſuch garments and attire as my poore abilitie could prouide. But when I had gone through it, and found a maime at the laſt (for the good man was firſt of all called to the glorie of heauen, out of this world, before he had or could expreſſe it in his intended treatiſe) I knew not what to doe, but ſtood ſtill, amazed and perplexed, thinking with my ſelfe, that if it ſhould goe forward without the legs, it would be refuſed for an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: If I ſhould adde vnto it and not expreſſe my addition, thoſe learned men which had formerly ſeene it, would condemne all for counterfaite: If it ſhould ſtand ſtill and not go forward, the Printer might be diſcouraged
<pb facs="tcp:4351:3"/> in ſome other ſuch charitable courſe: And to thinke that the Authour had left that part in ſome other of his bookes and labours, and there to looke for it, was as if I ſhould haue wiſhed him aliue to end his owne worke, &amp; why ſhould I doe ſo good a man ſuch wrong as once to deſire his preſence on earth? who already before me was gone to heauen, rather I will trot out my purgatory paines, and runne out my race for him on earth: Theſe were my thoughts then in priuate, which now I publiſh to the world. And to you before all other moſt worthy, learned, and admired Deane, for as hee when he liued, preached theſe things at the Church of Saint <hi>Brides</hi> (which is an appurtenance of your Collegiate Church, whereof he was Paſtour, ſo alſo doe I eate my bread vpon your allowance, in another poſſeſſion of yours, wherein I make knowen to the world, and doe hereby deſire men that are now aliue, and thoſe that ſhall be hereafter borne, to take knowledge of your care for the good inſtruction of the ſoules of ſuch flocks, as Law and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie haue in former times appropriated to your Church of Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. I may not exhort you, it were boldneſſe, although I know your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe would beare it. This is your due, and receiue it as a <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> guift from a dead man, patronage it, for ſo much as is maſter <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> deſerueth fauour, and for the reſidue which is mine, it craueth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dou. You loue the Church and euery diuine thing, and therefore I haue preſumed to prefixe your name in the front of this diuine worke, that both learned and godly which ſhall euer ſee or read it, may know your pietie &amp; zealous affections, and pray with mee for the encreaſe of your fauour both with God and men, for your ſupportation by the holy Ghoſt, for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduancement to the good of God his Church, for the length of your daies to bee paſſed in quiet and contented health, and for your bleſſed and aſſured entrance into that which the later end of this treatiſe deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, namely, <hi>the kingdome of heauen.

But God forbid, but that the names of ſuch iuſt men ſhould be had in euerlaſting remembrance: therefore to you I commend this booke as the voice of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> preaching out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and if euer you lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued either maſter <hi>Greenham,</hi> or maſter <hi>Holland</hi> while they were liuing, and eſpecially the later, I do require you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, as you will anſwere both him and me at the appearing of our Sauiour, that you ſhew it now after his death. For your ſakes he ſpent his life, yea, and loſt his life; for his diligence in keeping his flock, &amp; teaching you in greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie brought him to that ſicknes, that cut off his daies. And ſeeing he had ſuch an ardent deſire to promote religion, &amp; conſidered that one day death would cloſe his eyes, and earth ſtop his mouth from preaching, in priuate he collected theſe inſtructions, with an intent to imprint them, for your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, when he ſhould be in his graue. Now you haue them, through the care of his poore widdow, and charitie of the Printer, whereinto I haue added a diſcourſe of our ioyes, and eſtate after the later day.

I preiudge no mans labours, I honour all, I deſire that all learned men would do their endeauour to preach when they be dead, (for our harueſt will be all eaten vp in a winter to come.) I wiſh readers to lay aſide ſcorne and raſh iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially ſuch as are idle themſelues (for a ſpirituall man muſt be the doer, and not the iudge of the Law.) I pray God encreaſe the number of good labourers in his vineyard (for good paſtours will be precious ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours in another age) and continue our bleſſed liberty of preaching, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, writing and hearing of the Goſpell of Chriſt.

Secondly, that by ſight of the creatures, which doe attend vpon vs, wee might in them diſcerne our Creator, the inuiſible God. Our ſences, looke how many they bee in number, ſo many ladders they may bee euerie day, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.) for vs to clime vp to behold the wiſedome, greatnes and goodneſſe of the Creator. And ſo muſt we daily taſt him, and ſee him in
<pb facs="tcp:4351:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> the creatures. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. Thirdly, to ſtop the mouthes of all Atheiſts which blaſpheme, ſaying, that man is as old as God himſelfe: wee ſee man is not ſo old as the pooreſt beaſt or worme on earth. Fourthly, leaſt any ſhould imagin, that man created ſome of the creatures, or at leaſtwiſe to haue beene of Gods counſell in the creation of them. Fiftly, to ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, and vnto all ages, the infinite wiſedome, power and goodneſſe of Almightie God: for if wee doe well conſider the frame of heauen and earth, and the creatures which are in them: we ſhould (as it were) thinke he had ſpent all his wiſedome and power in the creation of them: The Sunne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone how wonderfully is it made? <hi>nothing can be hid from the heat therof.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, how deere the firſt man was vnto God, it is moſt cleere by all the former arguments of his exellencie: But now the caſe is quite altered: for this ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> or man without Chriſt, is a <hi>very ſtranger, and enemie vnto God.

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.17.</note> from the deformitie and curſe which is vpon all creatures for the ſinne of man, wee heard before of Gods great loue to the firſt man, in his prouidence, in bleſsing and preparing the creatures to ſerue him: Now in this contrarie ſtate of man, all things (without Chriſt) are accurſed &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.

               <p>Thirdly, from the compariſon of that firſt image of his

Firſt, as touching his bodily ſubſtance, in the firſt ſtate he was naked, &amp; yet not aſhamed. <hi>Ge.</hi> 2.25. ſuch was the glory and maieſtie of that body: Now his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie is ſuch, that notwithſtanding hee bee receiued to grace, and reformed in ſome meaſure in Chriſt, yet till hee bee refined in the reſurrection, hee cannot well thinke of, much leſſe looke vpon his owne nakedneſſe without ſhame, as we ſee in our firſt Parents.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.7.</note> If our bodies in this mortalitie haue not a ſhadow of that excellent glory of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> it is all loſt. That body was bleſſed, void of all griefes: This body (wee know by our common experience) is ſubiect to euils innumerable: for wanting the guarde and fenſe of Gods prouidence, the weakeſt creatures, euen wormes and flies in a moment of time, deſtroy and conſume it: That body had a wonderfull perfection in all ſenſes: This feeble body hath many wants and great weaknes in all parts therof: That body was immortall: this is ſubiect to death and mortalitie euery houre, and to death eternall if it be not freed from the ſecond death by the precious death of Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Retentum mentis.</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for his ſoule and ſpirituall ſubſtance, where ſhined moſt the Image of God, it hath euer ſince loſt all grace and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Some poore light it hath in naturall things, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſight of God and goodneſſe, ſeruing onely to make him inexcuſable. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.20.

By this we cannot comprehend God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.5. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. for this is enemy to God and all goodneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. Next, this facultie is become ſo vaine, that in ſpirituall things it cannot diſcerne between truth and errour, euill and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17.

               <p>Secondly, the conſcience of the firſt man was full of true ioy, peace, and conſolation. This deformed <hi>Adam:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Free will is proper onely to God, and no creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</note> the firſt man had freedome and ſtrength to will and performe that which was good, holy, and right, yet was he and his will mutable, for God alone is immutable: This man hath a certaine libertie of will in all naturall, ciuill, and morall actions, and in euill things: but no ſtrength to will or deſire that which is good and acceptable vnto God,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had a wiſe heart, a meeke ſpirit, and all his affections well ordered, and well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the light which was in his minde: This ſecond man hath his affections, but ſo diſtempered and ſo diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he cannot gouerne them,<note place="margin">Receptum affectionum.</note> but is rather ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by them, till grace in Chriſt come <hi>to crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.

               <p>The fourth argument of the firſt mans excellencie,<note place="margin">The fourth Argument.</note> was his ſoueraigne dominion, and rule, and power which God gaue him ouer all creatures: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.

               <pb facs="tcp:4351:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Fourthly, now for the vſe of theſe trees: Firſt, I anſwere for the tree of life: The firſt vſe of it was, to lift vp their eies vnto the Lord God the authour of their life: and to put them in minde continually that by him, and for him alone, they liue, moue and haue their being. Secondly, it is certaine that it was vnto our firſt parents a liuely Sacrament of their immortalitie through Ieſus Chriſt, if they had continued in obedience. The fruits thereof did well repreſent the benefits of Chriſt. <hi>Reue.</hi> 2.7. We may not imagine that this tree had any ſuch vertue in it ſelfe, to giue immortalitie vnto others, which it could not giue it ſelfe, but by gods ſpeciall ordinance it was vnto them a liuely ſeale of immortalitie through Chriſt during their obedience. Like as the raine-bow was ordained of God to ſignifie and ſeale that after the floud which it did not before: and as wee ſee the ſuperſcription of the Prince cauſeth that part of the mettle which is ſtamped and coyned to differ in vſe and value from that which is not coyned.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, here we may learne, if our firſt parents had neede of Signes and Sacraments to lift vp their eyes to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and to ſeale the word, how much more haue we? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if they then could not preſerue life but by the Lord of life Ieſus Chriſt, where ſhall we looke for life if we turne vs to any other but vnto this bleſſed tree of life Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, for the tree of knowledge of good and euill, to paſſe by mens coniectures ſufficient it is for vs to know, that it was ſo called, not for any poyſon or deadly infection that this tree had in it ſelfe more then any other tree, or more then our Sacramentall bread and wine containe any ſpeciall bane or poyſon in them, and yet he that eateth theſe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely, eateth and drinketh his owne iudgement. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. but <hi>metonymically,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Effect for the cauſe.</note> or by a figure, it was ſo called, beecauſe that who ſo did eate thereof (God hauing made a law to the contrary) ſhould forthwith feele and finde the loſſe of their excellent libertie, and bee poſſeſt with extreame and preſent miſerie.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, when the woman gaue the Serpent ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4351:12"/> in miſleadging Gods holy Law, <hi>yee ſhall not touch it:</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Fight againſt all doubts of Gods word. Eph. 4.14. Col. 2.2.</note> and in doubting of the truth thereof: <hi>leaſt ye dye:</hi> for to doubt, is to wauer concerning Gods truth, neither to be with it, nor againſt it. Then began hee to be more bold and vehement: and following her doubtfull concluſion, makes it more doubtfull: ſaying, <hi>ye ſhall not ſo dye,</hi> or <hi>ſo</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Thus ſpeakes he in all vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers againſt the word.</note> 
                  <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely dye,</hi> and hereunto he addeth a ſpeciall confirmation full of ſophiſtrie and deceit. For his confirmation and proofe ſtands of notable blaſphemies and lyes, you neede not ſo doubt to eate of the forbidden tree: Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Blaſphemie.</note> for that God in this prohibition doth know this fact would turne to your great good. Secondly, for that it is very manifeſt,<note place="margin">2. blaphemie and lye.</note> that the feeding on this tree ſhall cauſe you to abound in great knowledge of deepe miſteries. Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Blaſphemie.</note> for that by this tree ye ſhall haue ſuch a change of nature that ye ſhall after ſome ſort be Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, equall to God, or to his glorious Angels: and ſo hee tempted Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. for the wings of vaine glory, makes many follow after Sathan, and flie aloft to their vtter ruine and perdition.</p>
               <p>Eightly, wee may here obſerue Sathans boldneſſe, to vtter many lyes and blaſphemies one after an other, when hee ſeeth vs to let goe our faſt <note n="*" place="margin">Diabolus non eſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè peſsimus.</note> hold and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne of Gods holy truth, and not to tremble when wee heare his name or truth blaſphemed: Wherefore let vs keepe faſt the word of truth in an honeſt and a good heart, for if we forſake it, God will forſake vs, and giue vs ouer to beleeue lyes and blaſphemies, as here we ſee. 2. <hi>Th.</hi> 2.9.10.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, where as Sathan doth promiſe her that by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the forbidden fruite <hi>their eyes ſhould bee opened,</hi> hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues with a phraſe or ſentence full of ambiguitie: as may appeare by theſe ſpeciall differences following. For the eyes of the body are opened: Firſt, when the blinde are cured. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9. Secondly, when a man ſeeth that hee could not ſee before, albeit he was not blinde: as <hi>Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Gehezi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 22.31. 2. Kings. 6.17. Gen. 16.21. 2. King. 6.19.</note> and <hi>Agar</hi> the Angels of God. Thirdly, when men ſee plainely, that which they ſaw before darkely: as <hi>Eliſhas</hi> enemies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:4351:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> to Samaria and the two diſciples going to Emaus. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the eyes of the minde are opened: Firſt by inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. Secondly, by aduerſitie. <hi>Iob</hi> 33.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Luke.</hi> 15. Thirdly, by the biting, griping, and tormenting of the conſcience for ſinne: and thus were <hi>Adams</hi> eyes opened. And this the diuell intendeth what ſo euer he pretendeth.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, To conclude corcerning this conference. Firſt, here remember this inſtruction to hold faſt the word of truth, and hide it in thine heart. <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.1.2.3. So ſoone as a man begins to let goe his hold, and lightly to regard it, or to doubt of it, hee begins to ſhake off the true feare of God. It is our faith which knitteth vs vnto God, and vnbeleefe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs from him. Secondly; next remember, it is a bad ſigne of a cold heart, emptied of Gods ſpirit, if we can heare the holy name of God, or his bleſſed word blaſphemed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out griefe and trembling.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Queſt</hi> 12. Thus farre of the conference. Now let mee heare of the fact, and euent which followed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, actuall rebellion followed after the former inward and ſecret ſinnes of the minde and heart, as we ſee. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <note place="margin">The ſignes &amp; the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the firſt &amp; ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d death immediately poſſeſt them.</note> Secondly, This actuall rebellion and apoſtacie from God brought preſent miſerie vpon their ſoules and bodies. ver. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By ſinne came death.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Precept.</note>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The words are theſe: <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which haue brought thee out of the land of Egipt, out of the houſe of bondage. Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods before mee.</hi> In theſe wordes I conſider two things: firſt, a preface: ſecondly, a precept. The preface containeth three ſpeciall arguments, from the excellency, greatneſſe, and goodneſſe of the Law-giuer, ſeruing right well to moue Gods people, with attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reuerence to heare and to receiue all the words of this Law.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, from the right of creation, <hi>I am Iehoua,</hi> he that is Lord ouer all, from whom, by whom, &amp; for whom are all things, may iuſtly and rightly command all of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to obey his Laws:<note place="margin">Ex illo ſunt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, et poſſe, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſuſtinet, omnia regit. The Iewes are ſo ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that they neither dare ſpeak nor write the name Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, but in place of it, when they ſpeake or write they vſe the word Adonai.</note> 
                     <hi>Iehoua</hi> is ſuch a Lord: therefore are wee bound to heare him and obey him. The name <hi>Iehoua</hi> teacheth vs what the eſſence and glorious maieſtie of God is: that hee alone hath his being of himſelfe, and is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and cauſe of all things that are in heauen and earth, ſuſtaining and ruling all things by his mightie power. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>of him from him, by him, through him, and for him are all things.</hi> This name alſo ſignifieth vnto vs that hee is true and conſtant in his word and promiſe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.2.3. So then wee ſee theſe three conſequents, may iuſtly and rightly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from this firſt argument. Firſt, If hee giue life and being vnto all things, and ſuſtaine all things, good reaſon he ſhould commaund and rule all things. Secondly, if hee bee alone of ſuch excellencie, as his name importeth, then muſt hee bee our God alone and none other. Thirdly, If hee bee <hi>Iehoua,</hi> true and conſtant in his word, then ſhall no iot or leaſt part of his lawes and promiſes paſſe till all things bee performed.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4351:26"/> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. The ſecond argument is this: <hi>I am thy God:</hi> that is, which haue bound my ſelfe vnto thee by a free coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace and mercy in Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.33.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon in forme ſeruing the firſt Law thus.</p>
                  <p>That God which hath and can make alone an euerlaſting couenant of peace and mercie in Ieſus Chriſt, is to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged for the true God, and worſhipped alone. <hi>Iehoua</hi> is the God of that eternall couenant of peace, &amp;c. therefore <hi>Iehoua</hi> the true God, is to bee worſhipped alone and none other.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon applyed to al the commandements thus.</p>
                  <p>The God which hath graunted vs his free couenant, &amp;c. wee are <note place="margin">

                     </note> bound to obay all his Lawes: theſe ten precepts are his Lawes, therefore we are bound to obay them.</p>
                  <q>Which hath brought thee out of the land of Egipt, out of the houſe of bondage.</q>
                  <p>Theſe words containe three arguments, from their late deliuerance from Egipt, which may ſerue alſo for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſecond part of the ſecond reaſon going bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus.</p>
                  <p>That God of whoſe greatneſſe and goodneſſe in thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from that Egiptian bondage, thou haſt a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable experience hee is thy God by couenant, and let him bee thy God and none other: and much bound art thou to heare and to obey his Lawes. <hi>Iehoua</hi> is that God, which hath brought thee out of Egipt, and out of bondage, for a people freed from bondage are neuer their owne, but his which f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The holy Ghoſt warnes this people often, neuer to forget that bondage and their happy deliuerance. And the Apoſtle telleth vs that theſe things which were done for the Church, then were ſignes and types, of ſpirituall things.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt for the ſcope, it is this, that with all care and conſcience we worſhip God in that forme hee hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in his word and not after mans inuention. The firſt law was, concerning the duties which doe directly concerne the nature and perſon of God, and touching the ſubſtance of his worſhip: this Law is concerning the forme and manner of his ſeruice: and here the queſtion is anſwered (which hath moſt diſquieted the Chruch in all ages) who ſhall preſcribe the forme of Gods worſhip? ſhall Angels? ſhall men? ſhall the Church? ſhall Councels? ſhall the learned and the wiſe, or ſhall euery man ſerue God according to the imaginations of his owne heart?

                        <p>Secondly, the ſumme therfore of this Law in few words it is this: worſhip the Lord thy God according to his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will written in his word, and neuer preſume to offer him any will-worſhip of humane inuention.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, for the ſenſe: the words are theſe: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image.</hi> The Lords meaning is

If but a meane Prince would thus binde himſelfe to vs, and to our children, wee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forget the clemencie: and often ſollicit him for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof, how much more bound be we to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the rich mercies of God in Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> ſo often promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Godly and his clildren. <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.7. <hi>hee that walketh in his integritie is iuſt, and bleſſed ſhall his children bee after him.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> If God hath preſcribed his word vnto man in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeciall branches of his worſhippe: and bound his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a preſcript forme from the which they may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, much more in preaching, which is one principall part of his holy ſeruice and worſhip.

                        <p>Firſt, to prepare the minde: preaching and reading muſt neuer bee ſeuered. In reading regard for matter,<note place="margin">1.

                        <p>Secondly, prepare the heart, for there reſts the immortall ſeede of regeneration. <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.15. This preparation is firſt by prayer,<note place="margin">1.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here the ſpirit of God ſeemes to require of vs theſe three things: firſt a diligent attention of the eare to heare: ſecondly, a conſiderate intention of the minde to conceiue: thirdly, a faithfull retention of the heart to hold faſt, and keepe the holy will of God reuealed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. Attention.</note>Firſt, for attention, God requires the eare ſpecially and the eye to attend on him while he ſpeaketh: the eare. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.1.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.10. the eye. <hi>Luke.</hi> 4.20. <note n="a" place="margin">Nehe. 8.3.

                        <p>Secondly, God requires a godly minde to conſider well and ſeriouſly of the holy word which is taught: this will cauſe men to obſerue wiſely the booke, the text, and the doctrines which are deliuered:<note place="margin">2. Intention.</note> a fearefull ſigne of wrath is it to heare much and to vnderſtand nothing, this ſpeakes the Apoſtle. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.4. <hi>If the Goſpell bee then hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4351:42"/> that is of infidels, that the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt, which is the Image of God, ſhould not ſhine vnto them. Deut.</hi> 29.4. here let it not content thee to obſerue ſome words or ſillables or ſentences: but wiſely conſider of all doctrines and exhortations, and learne to referre all to ſpeciall heads and grounds of the Catechiſme: This intention is a true note of the Lords worke in opening the heart. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Retention.</note> whereas God here requires a faithfull retention of the heart: know this that a good heart to keep the word is a great treaſure and a ſpeciall grace of Gods holy ſpirit. And this heart men haue, which are ſo changed and ſo renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heart, that they can finde in their owne hearts thoſe liuely impreſsions and formes of doctrine, as it were, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally grauen or pictured in their owne hearts, by the working of Gods ſpirit in the miniſtrie of the word. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. and obey from the heart vnto the forme of the doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they are deliuered, deſiring to retaine the word that they may fruitfully practiſe it. <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Mat,</hi> 7.21.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here againe God requires meditation of vs that wee may poſſeſſe the good things wee haue heard, and that they may haue deeper impreſsion in vs. This meditation is either with our ſelues, or with others. Meditation with our ſelues is eyther, of the mind, or of the heart. The meditation of the minde is a diſcourſing with our owne vnderſtanding of all that wee haue heard and can remember: a number are well affected with the word in the Church, and for want of this exerciſe when they are gone, their affection ſoone dyes in them. And here wee labour yet better, for the clearing and vnderſtanding (by the light of the Scriptures) of all ſuch doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines as wee haue receiued. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. This meditation the Heathen call the refining of iudgement, the life of all good learning. This ſerues well for the increaſe of knowledge and ſound iudgement.</p>
                        <p>The meditation of the heart followes after: and here by
<pb facs="tcp:4351:43"/> due examination of our hearts, wee cauſe the things wee haue heard and well conceiued to worke vpon our hearts and affections. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. Wee muſt firſt ſettle our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before we either feare or chere vp our hearts, leaſt we haue falſe feares, or falſe ioyes: many haue iudgement and yet haue not their hearts purged, becauſe thy ioyne not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with iudgement.</p>
                        <p>Meditation with others is eyther with god, or men. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God, is by prayer or in prayer, to remember and to recite the good things we haue heard beefore the Lord, deſiring his holy ſpirit to write and to engraue the ſame in our hearts according to his holy promiſe. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. Meditation with men: wee call conference with the Godly, and this is with the brethren, either of the ſame congregation which heard with vs, as our owne familie <hi>Act.</hi> 17. and others. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.16. or the Godly Paſtors and Teachers themſelues if neede require. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.13.42. <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                        <p>And thus continuing in theſe holy exerciſes, the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper ſhall attaine by degrees Gods gratious bleſsing in time an aſſurance of ſpirituall wiſedome and vnderſtanding. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. his weake faith. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. ſhall bee made ſtrong in Chriſt, hee ſhall haue an aſſurance of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. his loue ſhall bee from the heart, and vnfained: and laſtly he ſhall attaine a ſound iudgement to diſcerne good and euill. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, the perſon which will haue his prayers accepted of
<pb facs="tcp:4351:44"/> God, muſt firſt ſee that himſelfe be in fauour and grace with God by faith in Ieſus Chriſt: for a polluted perſon which hath a polluted ſoule and conſcience,<note place="margin">Act. 15 9.</note> defiles the moſt holy exerciſes of religion <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.16. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.13.14. for faith grounded vpon the word of promiſe is the mother of all prayers, which haue acceptation with God. <hi>Iame.</hi> 1.6.7.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, God doth not onely require in this worſhip that a man bee in grace with him through Chriſt, and righteous in life, but alſo that when ſoeuer hee ſpeaks vnto him, hee come with a renued repentance: and put vp euery petition and requeſt in faith, for a man may bee a faithfull perſon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and yet an vnbeleeuer in particular. as the diſciples. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. <hi>Abraham.

                        <p>Fiftly, in euery petition wee make vnto God,<note place="margin">5.

To auoid battologies &amp; many words in prayer.</note> when wee ſpeake vnto God wee muſt not vſe any long continued ſpeach, raſhneſſe, nor many words, for this he ſpeaketh in a ſpeciall charge concerning this: <hi>Be not raſh in thy mouth, nor let thine heart bee haſtie, to vtter any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, for God is in the heauens and thou art on the earth, therefore let thy words be few. Eccleſi.</hi> 5.2. and Chriſt ſpeaketh thus: <hi>When thou prayeſt vſe no vaine repetition as the heathen: for they thinke to bee heard for their much babling, bee yee not like them therefore, for your heauenly father knoweth whereof ye haue neede, before ye aske of him. Mat.</hi> 6.7.8. and thus the Apoſtle biddeth vs <hi>pray continually.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. the Lords meaning is, not that wee ſhould euer bee in lip-labour, and omit all other duties; but that beſide our morning and euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice, we ſhould at all times and in all occaſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in our ſpirits the deſires of our hearts, our words and workes vnto God in the name of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Seauenthly,<note place="margin">7. The afflicted minde praies beſt, euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> often when he thinks his praiers bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</note> wee muſt not in paſsions of minde deſiſt or be weary, but ſeeke the Lord, and thinke vpon him the more wee bee troubled: yea albeit wee pray long, yet hee ſtill fils our ſpirits with anguiſh: yea albeit wee bee ſo buffeted and aſtoniſhed that we cannot ſpeake. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2.3.4.5. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I ſay all this affliction and trouble: wee muſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee perſwaded that wee doe not pray, nor that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth vs not, for it is an impoſture of Sathan and an error of conſcience, for the ſpirit of prayer euen in theſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>helpeth our infirmities: for wee know not what to pray as we ought</hi> (when wee ſeeme to pray beſt to our owne liking) <hi>but the Spirit it ſelfe makes requeſt for vs, with ſighes and grones which cannot bee expreſſed. Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
                        <p>Eightly, meditation is a neceſſary companion of all holy

                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:4351:47"/>
                        <p>Secondly, the Prophets iudge it a thing moſt vnreaſonable to compare the firſt cauſe of all ſenſe and reaſon vnto blocks which are void of all ſenſe and reaſon,<note place="margin">Dauid notably oppoſeth God and Idols.</note> for ſo we compare ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots for want of reaſon. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25.29. and to compare an infinite ſpirit to a finite body, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible and inuiſible God vnto a ſtock. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 40.21. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Habacuk.</hi> 2.18. for that his nature is ſuch as no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing can reſemle him, much leſſe aritficiall, no heauenly creature can repreſent him, much leſſe an earthly.</p>

                        <p>Fiftly, the very Gentiles had the ſame vſe of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which the Papiſts haue at this day: for they ſaid,<note place="margin">See Gregor. ep. 109. lib. 7. and ep. lib. 9. and Auguſt. in Pſal 113.

Ob We may picture Chriſt.</note> they did not worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, but the power of God preſent in them and by them.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, the Diuell practiſed in and by Images ſundrie kinds of illuſions in elder ages, as is well knowne hee doth euen to this day in the blinde Popiſh ſuperſtition.</p>
                        <p>Seauenthlie, but here they obiect againſt all this: firſt, that the Popiſh pictures in Churches, are but lay mens bookes, to put them in minde of diuine matters, which they can not otherwiſe ſo well conceiue, and ſoone forget. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The holie Ghoſt anſweareth, that there is no agreement nor fellowſhip betweene the Temple of God and Idols. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. and telleth vs by his Prophet they teach lies. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.3.8. <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.18.</p>
                        <p>Secondlie, next it is obiected: that albeit it be granted, that we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold, or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or ſtone, grauen by art, &amp; the inuention of man. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.29. And that wee may not picture the Father in the forme of an aged man (as the Papiſts doe) for albeit <hi>Daniell</hi> call him
<pb facs="tcp:4351:48"/> the auncient of daies, yet Saint <hi>Iames</hi> telleth vs there is no ſhadowe nor appearance of any change in him: yet if it may bee graunted, that the holy Ghoſt may bee reſembled by a doue, or by clouen tongues as <hi>Mat</hi> 3.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Anſ.</hi> No ſuch pictures can repreſent him: for the doue was not ſent to that end, but to be a viſible ſigne of the preſence of gods holy ſpirit which is inuiſible: as the clouen tongues were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a ſimbole to the ſame purpoſe, where alſo the wind there mentioned doth more fitly repreſent the ſpirit, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. and the tongues the guifts of the ſame ſpirit. So likewiſe the Doue may in ſome ſort ſet before vs the graces and gifts of the ſame loue, and meekeneſſe. And to this end the cloud vnto the people of the Iewes did ſerue as a ſpeciall ſimbole of the preſence of Iehoua, Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt: yet neuer painted to reſemble God, or to bee adored, or to worſhip God by it in the Church of the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">3. Obiect. of the picture of Chriſt.</note>Thirdly, it is obiected, that the humanitie of Chriſt, and the picture of Chriſt crucified may be allowed, not for ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration but in ſigne of loue and commemoration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I anſwere in the words of the Apoſtle. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. labour that Ieſus Chriſt may be ſo pictured by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell in the minde, that thou maiſt by the eie of faith behold him as clearelie and more effectually then if hee were deſcribed in thy ſight and crucified beefore thee: <hi>For by faith wee behold him which is inuiſible. Heb.</hi> 11.1.27.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I ſay we be bound to diſcerne betweene the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious body of the Sonne of God, and the ſinfull carkaſes of mortall men: for that this is a miſterie moſt admirable that God ſhould be manifeſted in the fleſh. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. that God and man ſhould bee ſo vnited together that both natures make but one perſon: ſo as albeit death parted the naturall ſoule from the naturall body, yet that precious bodie was ſtill the body of that perſon which was the Son of God, no way ſubiect to any change or corruption. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.27. An Image will teach vs to diſioyne in our mindes thoſe holie natures which God hath ſo conioyned as man ought not in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4351:48"/> thoughts of his heart to ſeparate them, but euer by ſpirituall wiſdome and faith to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The Turks Preſent ſent to the pope is but a fabulous ground for any true hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian by ſuch a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor his Lord and maiſter Ieſus Chriſt.</note> I ſay if no man on the earth can at this day giue vs the true picture of Chriſt: then is it intollerable audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe for any earthlie man to counterfaite falſelie his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie parts and members.

And if a man cannot beare to be abuſed and falſely or vntruly reſembled and conterfaited by picture: ſhall we thinke it none offence to the Sonne of God?</p>
                        <p>Fourthlie, wee may reaſon from the writings of the holie Euangeliſts, who were appointed and ſent from God, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to diſcribe the Sonne of God Ieſus Chriſt: for if they with one conſent, denie vs any helpe at all, or any one liue concerning the externall lineaments, and forme of his bodie: then ought not man to preſume to picture Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his owne inuention: but wee ſee clearely how the foure Euangeliſts purpoſelie paſſe ouer this matter, the holie Ghoſt foreſeeing the ſuperſtition of Antichriſt, and how the Popiſh painted Chriſts ſhould bee worſhipped, to the great diſhonour of our euerlaſting Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Fiftlie, wee may reaſon againſt this Popiſh God on this manner: if that picture of Chriſt, which was allowed and commanded of God himſelfe. <hi>Num.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Io.</hi> 3.14. being ſuperſtitiouſlie abuſed, muſt be burnt to aſhes. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. then much more theſe falſe pictures of Chriſt neuer allowed, but diſſalowed of God, and moſt impiouſlie adored of vaine men, ought to bee reiected with a farre greater deteſtation.

                        <p>The fourth obiection, they ſay the picture of Chriſt ſerues well to confute the old Heretikes, The Martionites and Valentinians which denied that Chriſt had a true, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, humane bodie.</p>

                        <p>The Godly Emperours <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> made a law, that none ſhould make any Image of our Sauiour.

                        <p>The conſcience here by this light truly examined will ſay, and confeſſe as followeth: I haue thought that if a man did worſhip God with a good minde and meaning, after the cuſtome of the Church of Rome it would be well accepted: I haue thought the preaching of the Goſpell fooliſhneſſe: I haue thought a man might well pray to Saints and Soules departed: I haue thought, a man for faith need not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to beleeue quietly as our forefathers, and as the Church doth beleeue: I haue thought, a man hath no ſuch neede to read or heare the word of God with ſuch care and conſcience: I neuer came to Church with ſuch preparation as here is required: and when I departed I was no whit wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then when I came into the Church: I haue thought, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4351:52"/> God being inuiſible might beſt bee honored being repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome Image ſet before vs: I haue thought, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were godly ornaments for the Church, and pretie books for ignorant people: I haue thought, that Images, ſpecially of Chriſt and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> haue vertue and power to worke miracles: I haue thought all the worſhip of God in the Maſſe very good deuotion, pilgrimages, reliques of Saints, and ſuch like ware as the Church of Rome ſold vs to bee great helps to pietie and to Gods holy worſhip. And for the traditions of my Fathers, my opinion reſted more in the auncient beleefe of my late progenitors, then in the prime and immediate law of God, I could neuer beeleeue but that an humble and good minde, without the Law of God was as acceptable as all the inſtruction of the Goſpell, and that it was a Godly thing, to faſt, to cut, to whip, and to afflict my body, although I were neuer ſo commuanded by God: it was as I thought a glorious thing to worſhip the Angels &amp; the Saints departed, neither did I euer till now ſee any cauſe why I ſhould not pray for my departed friends: yea, vntill now I cared for nothing but to pleaſe the world, and I would neuer haue yeelded to worſhip God, but becauſe the King, State, and great men of the world did like and approue ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but oh how farre haue I erred from the Law of God? as farre as euer <hi>Paul</hi> went from Ieruſalem, or as any ſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out maſt or ſterne in the middeſt of the ſea from hauen, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore I will vnload my euill wares, and goe vnto the holy word of God that I may buy more without monie, that I may ſearch for wiſedome, as for treaſure, and for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge aboue precious ſtones, O my ſoule thou haſt too long dwelt among theſe rocks of offence and vnprofitable friends, therefore yet at the laſt ſit downe at the feete of this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, bee not afraid of the voice of God, hee that harkneth to him hath choſen the better part, which ſhall neuer bee taken from him.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4351:56"/> not bee practiſed without Scriptures, Pater-noſters, Aues, and Creedes, and ſuch like good words.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, for exorciſmes, wee ſee in the practiſe of thoſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.13. the name of our Lord Ieſus prophaned, for <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith: <hi>That certaine vagabond Iewes exorciſtes, tooke in hand to name ouer them, which had euill ſpirits, the name of the Lord Ieſus, ſaying wee adiure you by Ieſus, whom Paul preacheth.</hi>

                        <p>Laſtly, wee are to know it for Gods diuine truth, that charmes, figures, words, characters can doe nothing: if any thing be done and acted, Sathan is the author, couering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnder theſe ſhadowes.

But to proceed to anſwere of this moſt chriſtian dutie of priuate admoninion: the firſt Law and great charge of God concerning it, is written. <hi>Leu.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but reproue thy neighbour freely or plainely, and ſuffer him not to ſinne, or let not his ſinne reſt vpon him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Here firſt conſider and obſerue the occaſion of theſe words in the former verſe immediately going beefore: for there wee haue two Lawes: the firſt is concerning our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good name, that wee neuer impaire it by walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout marchandizing of tales againſt it. The ſecond is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life that wee neuer conſent in any place or time to hurt the ſame. Then hee addeth this law as apointing a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall remedie and preſeruatiue againſt all ſuch euills.</p>
                           <p>In theſe words generally wee are to conſider: Firſt, the charge of God concerning this dutie, where note, firſt, whom to reproue: a <hi>brother,</hi> no ſtranger: ſecondly, the forme, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and plainely. Secondly, the confirmation of the charge: firſt, to omit this dutie is an argument of deadly hatred, <hi>thou ſhalt not hate him in thine heart:</hi> ſecondly, to omit this dutie is to leaue our brother in a moſt lamentable eſtate, for ſo his ſinne will reſt vpon him, or hee will lye, and it may be die in his ſinne.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, of the dutie here commaunded, next of the motiues annexed to practiſe the ſame. Firſt, of this dutie the ſpirit of God ſpeaketh often, giuing vs ſpeciall rules concerning it in the Old and in the New Teſtament. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.16. <hi>If thy brother</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, of this dutie ſpeakes Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ver. 20.21.22.23. <hi>But yee beloued, edifie your ſelues in your moſt holy faith, praying in the holy Ghoſt: and keepe your ſelues in the loue of God, loking for the mercie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt vnto eternall life: and haue compaſsion of ſome in putting difference, and others ſaue with feare, pulling them out of the fire, and hate the garment ſpotted with the fleſh.</hi> This Scripture teacheth vs: firſt, to performe this dutie to brethren not to ſtrangers: ſecondly, that when we reproue, we labour alſo to inſtruct and to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch brethren in the faith of Chriſt: thirdly, that we adde feruent prayer to our priuate admonition: Fourthly, that wee watch carefully one of vs ouer an other: Fiftly, that wee labour for the ſpirit of iudgement to diſcerne betweene ſuch as ſinne of infirmitie, and them which ſinne of pride and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: Sixtly, that we reproue the weake with all compaſsion and lenitie: Seauenthly, that we deale more roughly, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely with the proud: Eightly, that ſuch as will admoniſh muſt bee vnſpotted and blameleſſe.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, of this dutie ſpeakes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans 6. Chap ver. 1. <hi>Brethren if a man be fallen by occaſion into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fault, ye which are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuch a one with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, conſidering thy ſelfleaſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> Here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine we be taught: firſt, that this dutie is to be practiſed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among brethren. Secondly, there is no exception of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, of any degree or condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatſoeuer, but if he offend, hee muſt beare a priuate admonition. Thirdly, that we muſt diſcerne what kinde of ſinne, and in what maner our brother is fallen: whether hee bee preoccupied by men or Angels, and ſo fallen by occaſion into any fault, or reſting and lying in a ſinne not beefore manifeſted. Fourthly, that a Chriſtian reproofe muſt bee performed with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe. Fiftly, that a Godly wiſe admonition is by good art and skill to cure, and to reſtore a member fallen and looſed out of ioynt, into his right place againe. Sixtly, the argument annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:4351:60"/> to performe this cure with the ſpirit of lenitie and loue is this: conſider well thy ſelfe, it may bee thou maiſt alſo be tempted, and fall in the like manner.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, againe of the ſame dutie writes the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, to the Hebrues, the 3. Chap. ver. 12. <hi>Take heed brethren; leaſt there bee in any of you an euill hart, and vnbeeleeuing to fall away from the liuing God: but exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leaſt any of you bee hardened through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of ſinne</hi> Here note againe: firſt, euery brother of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending muſt be admoniſhed. Secondly, any brother may fall without Gods ſpeciall grace, and the watchfulneſſe of the godly brethren, into moſt dangerous ſinnes, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees into apoſtacie. Thirdly, admonition muſt bee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout the whole courſe of our life.</p>
                           <p>Fiftly, againe to the Theſſalonians 2. Epiſtle, 3.14.15. ver. hee writes on this manner. <hi>If any man obey not our ſaying note him with a letter, and keepe no company with him that hee may bee aſhamed: yet count him not as an enemie, but admoniſh him as a brother.</hi> This Scripture is principally to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the publike cenſures of the Church: yet it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnto vs greatly as well priuate as publike admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and teacheth vs, that we may not conuerſe with brethren when they fall away from the holy canons of apoſtolicall doctrine, either to bee vicious in life, or hereticall or ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall in iudgement.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4351:60"/> a righteous man himſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of good report in the Church of God. Thirdly, an admonition is as a ſharpe corroſiue to our corruption, ſmiting, lancing and piercing deepely, but by degrees it will appeare a moſt ſoueraigne balme to cure euen very rotten and feſtered vlcers in vs. Fourthly, the Godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admoniſhed ſeeke vnto God by heartie and vnfained prayers, and thankſgiuing for themſelues and their brethren which haue done this cure vpon them.</p>

                              <note place="margin">What an oath is.</note>Secondly, this may bee the deſcription of an oath allowed by the Scriptures: <hi>An oath is an holy inuocation of God (as the beſt witneſſe of all truth, and the reuenger of all ſuch as prophane his name, in calling him to teſtifie to an vntruth</hi>) to end all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, for the clearing of the truth, and for the defence of iuſtice and of Lawes, ſpecially in iudgement. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4351:63"/> 
                              <hi>Ier</hi> 4.2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.11.12.13.</p>
                           <p>Rules to be obſerued.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Gods name muſt onely bee vſed in an oath, and none of the creatures, for that he alone ſercheth the heart.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, wee may neuer proceede to an oath, but when all other teſtimonies and proofes doe faile vs.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, hee that ſweareth muſt know the truth perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not offer himſelfe to it raſhly, but beeing called in iudgement for the defence of iuſtice. For hee that ſweareth for defence of an vntruth, maketh God a witneſſe-bearer to a lye. Hee that ſweareth things vncertaine, muſt haue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill conſcience: Hee that ſweareth things vnlawfull fayneth in God ſome contrary wills: Hee that ſweareth to things impoſsible, by his impious diſſembling (if it be in knowledge doth mocke the Lord, therefore <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaith: wee muſt ſwere <hi>in veritie,</hi> not falſely: <hi>in iudgement,</hi> not raſhly: <hi>in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> not to peruert iuſtice.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, it is great impietie to accept of the oath of ſuch men in iudgement for the ending of controuerſies, and the defence of truth and iuſtice, which feare not an oath, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually prophane the moſt holy name of God.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, they ſay that an oath is eyther voluntary and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or neceſſarie and publike. Againe, that an oath is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: firſt, aſſertorie, affirming or aſſuring any thing of the time paſt, or of the time preſent: or ſecondly, promiſſorie: of the future time.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the forme of an oath,<note place="margin">4. Forme of an oath.</note> that it is a calling vpon God to witneſſe of the ſinceritie of our hearts in our words and actions may appeare by this Scriptures. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. <hi>I ſpeak the truth and lye not, my conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt Phillip.</hi> 1.8. <hi>God is my record how I long after you all, from the very heart roote in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2 ver. 5. <hi>neyther did wee euer vſe flattering words, as yee know, nor colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red couetouſneſſe, God is record.</hi> Of this kinde are all oathes
<pb facs="tcp:4351:64"/> in admiſsion to magiſtracy, in ordination, and calling to the miniſtrie, to ſerue in a campe, &amp;c. Wherefore in an oath we are euer to reſpect carefully three things, firſt, the matter: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the forme: thirdly, the end. Firſt, the matter, that it bee waightie, cleare. Secondly, the forme, that it bee allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God. Thirdly, the end, the glory of God in the ending of controuerſies to the glory of God.</p>
                           <p>Fiftly, it is here doubted whether all oathes be to be kept, abeit the forme of our oath bee not lawfull, yet if the matter bee true, iuſt and cleare, it is a ſinne to breake it, as <hi>Labans</hi> oath to <hi>Iacob,</hi> or any Papiſt ſwearing by Maſſe, &amp;c. The rabbines of Ieruſalem were of contrary iudgement. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.16.</p>
                           <p>Rules for the keeping of an oath are theſe.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, wee may not keepe or obſerue our oath, when a thing is become impoſsible, which was poſsible when wee did ſweare: as he that ſweareth perpetuall chaſtitie thinking hee ſhall be able to performe it, yet afterward through conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall burning, findeth the contrary, hee is not bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that oath.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if the matter faile whatſoeuer the forme is, it may not be kept, as when we haue ſworne to doe any thing, the doing whereof is a manifeſt ſin and breach of Gods law: that oath may not bee kept, as <hi>Herods</hi> oath for the death of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt. Mar.</hi> 6. and the Iewes to kill <hi>Paul. Act.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Dauid</hi> knew that he had ſinned in ſwearing raſhly <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> death,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.21.</note> and was changed, and did bleſſe God afterwards for the changing of his minde.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if the matter or cauſe of our oath be lawfull, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it hard and to our loſſe, yet our oath muſt euer bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, vnder the Law it ſignifieth other feaſts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God wherin the people reſted, as on the ſeauenth day. <hi>Leu.</hi> 16.31.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, ſometimes it is taken for, firſt, weekely Saboth, the ſeauenth daie: ſecondlie, the monthly Saboth, the firſt daie of the month: thirdly, the Saboth of yeers, euery ſeauenth yeere. And fiftie, which was their Iubil: for the which they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeauen times ſeauen yeares, which makes fortie nine yeares, and the next after (which is the fiftieth) was their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both: fourthly, the great Saboth, and this was when the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer fell on the Saboth day: as when Chriſt ſuffered. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.31.

                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt ſignification literally, agreeth with this Law: now then firſt this very word teacheth vs that men ſhould reſt this daie, and wee can no more take away reſt from it then alter the name and nature:<note place="margin">Exod. 31.15.35.2.</note> and that this reſt is no idle reſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23. <hi>To morrow is the reſt of the holy Saboth.</hi>

                        <p>The Reaſons wherefore God requires our reſt from all our workes on the Saboth are theſe.<note place="margin">That men muſt reſt on the Saboth, and wherefore</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, the cheefeſt cauſe of this reſt is, that wee might wholy attend vpon Gods worſhip this day, for that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of this day requires a whole man. The affaires of this life are two diſtinct things: wee can neuer well intend the one, but when wee reſt from the other, for let a man on the Saboth what hee can ſequeſter himſelfe from the ordinarie workes of his calling, yet ſhall hee finde himſelfe (without ſpeciall preparation and ſanctification) maruelous vnapt to performe the duties of the Saboth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, wee may truelie and cleerely ſhew it thus:<note place="margin">From Adams example.</note> If <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſtate of glorie and innocencie had need of this reſt, that hee might the more freely giue his ſoule and bodie and applie himſelfe to God on this daie, and to the holie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of religion, then much more wee in this ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                        <p>The third reaſon may be this, for the retaining of health:<note place="margin">For health.</note> for when wee doe ſeriouſlie exerciſe the minde in hearing, praier and meditation, the bodie muſt haue reſt. <hi>Adam</hi> had no neede of any ſuch refreſhing, for he labored without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe: yet that his minde might more intend his holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, hee was commanded to reſt from all his works.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> This reaſon is pointed at. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.14. ſaying, <hi>that thy man-ſeruant may reſt as well as thou.</hi>

But ſome thinke this reſt of the Saboth was but ceremoniall, ſeruing the Iewes onelie to put them in minde of their freedome from the Egiptian bondage, and that they muſt reſt from ſinne, and ſo come to euerlaſting reſt. For the Apoſtle numbreth it with other ceremonies, taxing the Galathians in theſe words:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.10.</note> yee turne againe to impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and begerly rudiments: <hi>Yee obſerue dayes,</hi> as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths: <hi>and months,</hi> as the new Moones, the firſt and ſeauenth month. <hi>Times:</hi> as the feaſt of Eaſter, Whitſontide, Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Wee anſwere that the Law concerning the Saboth is partly ceremoniall, partlie morall.

But in that it was a ſet time appointed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate of God himſelfe for his publike worſhip and ſeruice, in this reſpect it muſt bee accepted as Gods morall Law, to bind the Gentiles as well as the Iewes for euer.</p>

                        <p>Fiftly and laſtly, wee may reaſon as a godly man againſt the Papiſts thus: They ſay the ſecond Commandement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Images is but ceremoniall, hee anſwereth, ſo long as wee finde our nature ſo prone to ſet vp an Image to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God by it, and to worſhip God beefore it: ſo long let that bee a morall Law to humble vs: In like maner may we ſay of the Saboth: So long as wee feele our corruption ſo to fight againſt the religious obſeruation of the Saboth, and ſo prone to prophane it: ſo long let vs alſo acknowledge it a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Law to binde our vnbridled affections: but wee ſhall finde a perpetuitie in the one, therefore there muſt bee the like perpetuitie in the other.</p>
                        <p>Sixtlie, this day is a great and glorious day by many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of excellencie: firſt, the firſt day of the world: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the firſt day of the manna: Thirdly, the daie of Chriſts Natiuitie and Baptiſme (as ſome thinke) and of his reſurrection, as all agree: Fourthlie, the day the holie Ghoſt deſcended: Fiftlie, the day the children of Iſraell paſſed ouer the red Sea: Sixtlie, the daie when <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes receiued their conſecration. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made let vs reioyce and be glad in it.</hi>

Now hauing thus farre taken ſome generall viewe of this Law: let vs conſider here what is commanded, and what is forbidden: how the Saboth is ſanctified, and how prophaned.

<pb facs="tcp:4351:71"/> Firſt, for if the Lord will not allow the moſt needfull work of ſeede time and harueſt on the Saboth, ſhall wee imagine hee will allow idle recreations: ſecondly, doe not our idle ſports as much alienate our mindes from the exerciſes of the Saboth, as the workes of our ordinarie callings? yea, much more: for that our luſts doe much more delight in theſe, and be poſſeſt with theſe exerciſes of recreations (as we call them) more then with any other worke, therefore theſe muſt make vs more vnfit for to keepe a holie Saboth, then cart and plow, for <hi>melius eſt arare quam ſaltare,</hi> it is better (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for Pſalme 91. to plow then to daunce.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, the end of this Law is, that with all reuerence and regard we preſerue the dignitie and honor of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that is, of all ſuch as God hath ſet ouer vs, as ſuperiours, and a religious care and gouernment of inferiours, beeing well aſſured that where the duties of ſuperiours and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours are neglected, there can neither religion, nor vertue nor any good thing proſper.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, this Commandement hath two parts: the one, the Law it ſelfe, where conſider: firſt, who be to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, father mother, that is, all ſuperiours: ſecondly, how and in what meaſure ſuperiours muſt bee reuerenced, <hi>Honour:</hi> thirdly,<note place="margin">Senſe.</note> who muſt honour, children: that is, all inferiours: the other confirmation: that they may prolong thy dayes, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, the Church is a ſpeciall mother for vs on earth, whoſe honour wee muſt tenderly reſpect, for hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth her, God reiecteth him, and muſt account him as a Publican. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.<note place="margin">Eſ. 49.23.

                           <hi>Mother,</hi> Shee may not bee neglected, but all duties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done vnto her notwithſtanding her weakneſſe, ſex and all her infirmities, beecauſe naturall corruption doth ſoone break forth into contempt and rebellion againſt the mother, therefore the Lord hath made ſpeciall mention of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Law,<note place="margin">Prou. 1.8.

                        <p>Now if we aske a reaſon wherefore all inferiours are thus bound of God to yeeld this honour to their ſuperiours: the cauſe is manifeſt. The Lord himſelfe doth inueſt them with his honour, they ſit all ouer vs as Gods vicegerents, and in euery one of them wee muſt euer conſider that Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed image is ſet before our eyes: firſt, in the naturall parents wee behold Gods tender affection towards vs: ſecondly, in the Princes and Rulers we finde a certaine image of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and glory of God: thirdly, in aged men ye haue the picture of Gods eternitie: Fourthly, in a wiſe man the image of Gods wiſedome ſhineth before our eyes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That they may prolong thy dayes:</hi> Parents are ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long life, becauſe they be the inſtruments of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hereunto. They may truely bee ſayde vnder God to
<pb facs="tcp:4351:78"/> prolonge the life of their children: firſt by their good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and inſtruction ſpecially in Gods holy worſhip and ſeruice when they bee young: ſecondly, by their wiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement when they come to riper yeares: thirdly, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them ſome lawfull calling, and honeſt meanes for their maintenance, when they come to age: Fourthly, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall bleſsing of them, and of all meanes for their good, by recommending them continually vnto God in prayer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thy dayes on the Land which the Lord thy God giueth thee,</hi> This is that ſpeciall promiſe noted by the Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Iuſt. I.C. lib. 2. cap. 8. ſer. 37.</note> 
                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1.2. and expounded thus: <hi>That it may goe well with thee, and that thou maiſt liue long on earth,</hi> godly children haue the promiſes both of this life, and of that which is to come. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. and contrarilie the fearefull threatning of God is often verified of rebellious children. <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.17. <hi>The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtructions of his mother, let the Rauens of the valley pick it out, and the young Eagles eat him.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, the firſt dutie (following the order of nature)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4351:79"/> is of the mother that with all care and conſcience ſhee inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the preſeruation of the life of her childe euen from the firſt conception in her wombe (albeit ſhee endure many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes as Gods ſpeciall chaſticements for her good) till it bee borne, and come to yeares of ſtrength.<note place="margin">A barren wombe better then a barren breſt.</note> Wherefore here a ſpeciall dutie lying on the mother is the nouriſhing of her owne children with her owne breſts, if the Lord ſhall graunt her that good bleſsing: firſt, for that the holy Ghoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts this one good note of a Godly matrone. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.10. <hi>She is well reported of for good works:</hi> next is added, <hi>if ſhe haue nouriſhed her children.</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, the examples of holy women muſt bee follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe daughters religious mothers are ſaid to bee, when they doe well and doe performe duties. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. But <hi>Sarah</hi> gaue ſuck to her owne ſonne <hi>Iſaach. Gen.</hi> 21.7. albeit ſhee had many women in her family which might haue eaſed her of that dutie.

                        <p>A ſecond dutie which ſpecially concernes the husband as head, is to prouide for the family, for the maintenance of wife and children. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>If there be any that prouideth not for his owne, and namely, for them of his houſhold, he denieth the faith and is worſe then an Infidell.</hi> This care and conſcience we finde in <hi>Iacob,</hi> when hee anſwereth <hi>Laban</hi> of his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice hee addeth theſe words. I haue ſerued thee long and thou art become rich through my diligence and faithfulnes: <hi>now when ſhall I trauell for mine owne houſe alſo. Gen.</hi> 30. ver. 30.</p>
                        <p>A third dutie common to both Parents is this: to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize, inſtruct and to bring vp their children in the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:4351:80"/> and information of the Lord. That this dutie concernes father and mother ioyntly, appeares. <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.17.

Deu.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart: and thou ſhalt rehearſe them continually vnto thy children, and ſhalt talke of them, when thou tarrieſt in thine houſe, and as thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lyeſt downe, and when thou riſeſt vp.</hi> To this charge agree the words of the Apoſtle. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prouoke not your children to wrath, but bring them vp in inſtruction and information of the Lord.</hi>

                        <p>A fourth dutie of parents is to correct and chaſtice their Children with wiſedome and moderation, euer conſidering they puniſh their owne corruption in them, which they firſt gaue, and calling vpon God in ſpirit feruently for a bleſsing vpon their chaſtetiſements.

                        <p>A fift dutie of parents is the good education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as in Gods faith and feare principally, ſo in good arts carefully, that they may beecome profitable members in Church and common wealth, for this is the Lords charge. <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Teach a child in the trade of his way, and when he is old he ſhall not depart from it,</hi> at the leaſt let them learne

                        <p>A ſixt dutie of parents to children is that hauing brought vp their children in ſuch ſobrietie and chaſtitie as beecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Saints of God, when they come to yeares, to make choice for them, and to aduiſe them to keepe their veſſells alwayes in holineſſe and honour, both in the ſingle ſtate, and in the married life, and at this time ſpecially to allow for their maintenance more or leſſe, according to that portion which God hath giuen them. This godly care for the mariage and maintenance of children wee ſee in <hi>Abraham. Gen.</hi> 24.1.2. and in <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca. Gen.</hi> 27.46. and Cha. 26.35. and in <hi>Naomi.

                        <p>A ſeauenth dutie is, ſuch children as the Lord ſhall giue thee, to conſecrate them to the Lord, with a holy deſire they be his, and doe him ſeruice, as <hi>Hamah</hi> did <hi>Samuel,</hi> and it may bee <hi>Ennice</hi> did <hi>Timothie:</hi> God ſpecially requireth the firſt borne.</p>

                        <p>Sinnes of Parents forbidden in this Law are theſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, to bee improuident, and not to reſpect the welfare of children in this life.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, to cark and care for their bodies, and to ſuffer their ſoules to rot in ſinne. <note n="*" place="margin">Crates in Plutarch ſaith, We may well cry againſt fooliſh parents from the tops of hilles: with great cares doe they prouide for their children, but reſpect not for honeſtie &amp; vertue what they ſhall bee</note> Heathen men could ſee this as a common ſinne in Parents and condemne it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, to bring them vp in looſeneſſe, pride, idleneſſe, and wantonneſſe, (and wantonneſſe ends in wickedneſſe) as <hi>Eli</hi> did <hi>Sophin</hi> and <hi>Phiceha,</hi> and as <hi>Dauid</hi> did <hi>Abſalon</hi> and <hi>Adonijah:</hi> their wanntonneſſe did end in wickedneſſe, to the no ſmall griefe of his heart, <note n="a" place="margin">1.

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> This precept ſpeaketh vnto children, as it were, face to face, as being moſt prone to the breach of this Law: for children bee more ready to forget Parents and their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then Parents to forget children: and therefore the Lord to meete with this corruption, giueth the firſt charge vnto children, to performe all duties of honour to their Parents.</p>
                        <p>The firſt dutie of Children to Parents, and the root of all the reſt is a cheerefull reuerence, which is a ſpeciall grace well tempered with loue and feare. An example for this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wee haue in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who when hee met his aged father <hi>Iacob.

                        <p>The ſecond dutie implyed in the word Honour, (as the Apoſtle interpreteth) <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1. is obedience: <hi>Children obay your Parents in the Lord.</hi> Examples of true obedience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded iuſtly in Scripture are theſe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Abraham. Gen.</hi> 22. the ſonnes of <hi>Ionadab</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Rechab. Ier.</hi> 35.14.

Luke.</hi> 2.51.</p>
                        <p>The third dutie, to helpe their infirmities, and to prouide for their Parents when they are old. Of this dutie the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.4. in theſe words. <hi>But if any widow haue children or nephewes, let them firſt learne to ſhew godlineſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their owne houſe, and to recompence their kindred, for this is an honeſt thing and acceptable before God.</hi> The practice of this dutie wee finde in good <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> moſt carefully ſupplying his old fathers wants, &amp; prouiding for his brethren. <hi>Ge.</hi> 45.9.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4351:81"/> and among Birds for the Storke when ſhe is old keepes her neſt continually, and the young prouide for her: hence is it the Apoſtle cals children without naturall affections. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.

                        <p>The fourth dutie here commanded is to beare with, and to couer the infirmities of parents, ſo much as in vs lyeth, and ſo farre as Gods honour and Law will permit vs. The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of this wee ſee in <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iapheth</hi> who couered their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked father, when curſed <hi>Cham</hi> diſcouered him. <hi>Ge.</hi> 9.23. and <hi>Ionathan</hi> bare patiently the threats of his bitter and bloudy father. <hi>Saul.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.3.4.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, to mocke or deſpiſe the father or mother is a great ſinne and tranſgreſsion of this Law: againſt the which the Lord pronounceth that fearefull threatning. <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.17. <hi>The eye that mocketh his father, and deſpiſeth the inſtruction of his mother, let the rauens of the valley pick it out, and the young Eagles eat it.

                        <p>Duties of Maiſters and of Gouernours of Families, be theſe following.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, they are bound by this morall Law of God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Seruants, as they muſt their Children, in the true knowledge of God: for without inſtruction how ſhall they ſerue them, as the Apoſtle commandeth, <hi>as ſeruing the Lord Chriſt.</hi> Againe the ſame Apoſtle. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9.10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth Seruants <hi>to adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things,</hi> without inſtruction they can neuer poſsibly grace it, but diſgrace and diſhonour both God and his word in all things they take in hand. The practiſe of this dutie wee ſee in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who being commanded to inſtruct <hi>his Children and his Houſhold. Gen.</hi> 18.19. it is recorded of him that he did carefully inſtruct and Catechize three hundred perſons in his familie. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14. In like manner this was <hi>Ioſuas</hi> care not onely for his Sonnes and Daughters but alſo for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as himſelfe teſtifieth. Chap. 24.15. where hee vſeth a holy proteſtation not onely for himſelfe and his Children, but alſo for his whole familie, <hi>that they ſhall ſerue the Lord,</hi> and this can neuer bee without inſtruction. The like conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and care wee finde in <hi>Cornelius</hi> the captaine. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.7. for hee is ſaid to haue <hi>Seruants fearing God.

                        <p>Secondly, Maiſters muſt giue Seruants and Children no euill example, but endeuour to goe before them, as holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents and examples of faith and godlines, of all puritie and ſobrietie of life, to guide them in all loue and meekeneſſe, wiſedome and iudgement: for ſo haue all the hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thirdly, the third dutie of Maiſters to Seruants is to giue them the recompence and reward of their labour: this the Apoſtle chargeth. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Ye Maſters doe to your Seruants that which is iuſt and equall, knowing that ye alſo haue a Maſter in heauen.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.18. <hi>The laborer is worthie of his wages. Leu.</hi> 19.13. <hi>The workemans hire ſhall not abide with thee vntill the morning.</hi> And here wee may ſay, that if humanitie requires that they bee liberally rewarded, much more pietie requires a louing an a large bountifulneſſe vnto good Seruants: of this ſpeakes the Sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> in theſe words. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 7.20.24. <hi>If thy Seruant worketh truely, intreat him not euill, nor the Hireling that beſtoweth himſelfe wholy for thee. Let thy ſoule loue a good Seruant, and defraud him not of libertie, neither leaue him a poore man.</hi> So louing a Maiſter was <hi>Abraham</hi> vnto his eldeſt Seruant <hi>Eleazar,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 15.2.3.</note> the Steward of his houſe that hee purpoſed in his heart (if God gaue no childe) to make him his Heire and Lord of all his ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the fourth and laſt care of Maſters and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of families, is to exerciſe houſhold or domeſticall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for the good gouernment of their families according to the rules of pietie. Of this dutie the Lord warneth vs. <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.19. <hi>A Seruant will not be chaſtiſed with words, though he vnderſtand yet he will not anſwere.</hi> ver. 21. <hi>He that bringeth vp his Seruants daintely from his youth, ſhall at the laſt be robbed of his Children.</hi> Such Seruants were <hi>Zimri</hi> to <hi>Ela</hi> king of Iſraell, who ſlew his Maiſter and his Children. 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 16.11. and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> to <hi>Salomon,</hi> who got from his Son <hi>Reheboam,</hi> more then halfe his kingdome. 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.28. and ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous hireling was <hi>Zibah</hi> to good <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. ver. 3.</p>
                        <p>Wee haue many good notes for the good gouerment of the family. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. firſt, the Maſters of families muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meditate and endeuour to temper well together <hi>mercie and iudgement.</hi> Secondly, they muſt walke wiſely and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giuing a good example of life to all committed to their charge. Thirdly, they muſt lay aſide all anger and wrath.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4351:84"/> Fourthly, they may not harbour ſlanderers, lyers, nor the marchants of tales to infect and poyſon the Familie. Fiftly, they muſt proceed to chaſticement of their Seruants, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more with mercy in the one hand and iudgement in the other.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, they muſt paſſe by and couer many faults in good Seruants. <hi>Eccles,</hi> 7.23. <hi>Giue not thine heart to all the words that men ſpeake, leaſt thou heare thy ſeruant curſe thee, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes alſo thine heart knoweth that thou haſt ſpoken euill of others.</hi> Secondly, puniſh the leſſer faults with admonitions. <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.10. <hi>A reproofe entreth more into him that hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, then an hundreth ſtripes into a foole.</hi> Thirdly, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinnes muſt bee cured with chaſticements and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for ſo the holy Ghoſt warneth. <hi>Prou.</hi> 29.19. <hi>An euill Seruant will not be chaſtiſed with words,</hi> he muſt haue ſtripes if his offence ſo require. Of this Seruant ſpeakes the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> in theſe words, Cha. 33.23. <hi>The foder, the whip and the burthen belong to the Aſſe, and meate, and correction, and work, to the Seruant.</hi> And againe, Chap. 42.5. <hi>Be not aſhamed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to beate an euill Seruant to the bloud.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But here proceed with iudgement: firſt, inquire the truth diligently: ſecondly, ſhew the danger and greatneſſe of the ſinne committed, by the Scripture: thirdly, if teares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any hope of vnfained repentance, twiſe or thriſe ſpare and forbeare ſtripes, then proceed with moderation: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and laſtly, if neither admonition nor correction cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment: expulſion is the higheſt degree in houſhold diſcipline: let not the proud and incorrigible ſinner abide in thine houſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. ver. 5. for this forme of gouernment and practiſe of houſhold diſcipline we haue an example in <hi>Plilemon</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, the duties of Seruants to their Maiſters are theſe following.</p>
                        <p>The firſt dutie of Seruants is an humble and Chriſtian ſubiection to their Maiſters and Gouernours, acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their authoritie with all ſubmiſsion of minde, in word and geſture: deſiring to pleaſe their Maiſters in all things in the Lord. The rule of this is written. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Let Seruants be ſubiect to their Maiſters, and pleaſe them in all things,</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is added, <hi>that they may adorne the doctrine of Chriſt our Sauiour in all things.</hi> Such was <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Ioſeph</hi> to <hi>Putiphar,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> Seruants. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. Without this humble ſubmiſsion and lowlineſſe of minde there is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice acceptable to God or men.</p>
                        <p>Their ſecond duty is actuall obedience: they muſt not only ſeeme lowly in minde, and louing in word, or verball ſeruice: They muſt bee faithfull alſo in their worke: they muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that ſeruice, which their Gouernours, according to Gods will, ſhall giue them in charge to doe: for thus they are commanded. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Seruants be obedient to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters according to the fleſh in all things fearing god.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Seruants which will pleaſe Chriſt in ſeruing their maiſters muſt well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe fiue rules.</note> The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and beleeuing Seruants which pleaſe Chriſt in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, muſt looke well to theſe notes and rules following.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, their obedience muſt bee tempered with feare and trembling. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5. not a ſeruile but a Chriſtian and filiall feare.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, their obedience muſt bee in all ſimplicitie ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſſe and truth of heart, voide of all fraud and colours, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4351:85"/> if their ſeruice were done immediately vnto the Lord Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they muſt looke that their obedience muſt bee in faith euer deſiring in all their ſeruice to pleaſe Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. ver. 7.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, God requires in their obedience all cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, for this will breed in them diligence and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe without wearineſſe and this the Apoſtle requireth ſaying: <hi>with a good will ſeruing the Lord. Eph.</hi> 6.7.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, and laſtly, faithfulneſſe is required in their ſeruice: and this is with all care and conſcience to labour in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for their Maiſters good. And this the holy Ghoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Let them ſhew all faithfulneſſe,</hi> that ſo they may adorne the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Examples for the practiſe of theſe rules are theſe: Firſt, that religious ſeruant in whom <hi>Abraham</hi> repoſed ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: when hee ſent him to prouide a wife for his ſonne <hi>Iſaac. Gen.</hi> 24. in him wee may obſerue many vertues, great ſubmiſsion and loue to his maiſter, a religious feare and faith, calling vpon God for a bleſsing on his ſeruice hee had in hand. ver. 12. diligence and care. ver. 32.33. <hi>I will not eat till I haue ſpoken my meſſage,</hi> faithfulneſſe, in returning with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beckah</hi> to his Lord and Maiſter. ver. 61.67.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the like vertues we finde in <hi>Iacob</hi> in all that his long and weariſome ſeruice vnto <hi>Laban</hi> twentie yeares, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and ſingleneſſe of heart, <hi>he was a plaine man. Gen.</hi> 25.27. a religious feare and faith euer worſhipping God and truſting in his prouidence, not diſcontented with his ſtate, of his diligence in his ſeruice thus he teſtifieth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.40. <hi>I was in the day conſumed with heat, and with froſt in the night, and my ſleepe departed from mine eyes:</hi> For his faithfulneſſe thus he ſpeaketh. ver. 38.39. <hi>Theſe twenty yeares haue I beene with thee, thy Sheepe and thy Goates haue not</hi>

The torne I brought it not vnto thee: but made it good my ſelfe, at my hands thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, were it ſtollen by day, or by night.</hi> The like conſcience and faithfulneſſe ſhall we finde in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in all his ſeruice.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4351:86"/>
                        <p>The third and laſt dutie and care of Seruants, muſt bee this: to ſubmit themſelues to rebukes and admonitions and corrections of all their Gouernours with all meekeneſſe of ſpirit:<note place="margin">
                              <p>All obiections of Seruants againſt their maſters are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in this Scripture.</p>

                           </note> remembring the word which Chriſt hath ſent vs by his holy ſpirit. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Submit your ſelues vnto all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake.</hi> And ver. 18. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants be ſubiect to your Maiſters with all feare, not onely to the good and curteous, but alſo to the froward: for this is thanke worthie, if a man for conſcience toward God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully, for what praiſe is it if when yee bee buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for your faults, ye take it patiently? But and if when yee doe well, ye ſuffer wrong, and take it patiently, this is acceptable to God: for hereunto ye are called: for Chriſt alſo ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps who did no ſinne, neither was guile found in his mouth, who when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe: when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed it to him that iudgeth righteouſly. Iacob</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> followed this Scripture, as beeing written by Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit in their hearts.</p>
                        <p>The Sinnes here forbidden are theſe.</p>
                        <p>The firſt foule ſinne here condemned, is eye ſeruice: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſimplicity and truth: deſiring to pleaſe men, but not in ſingleneſſe of heart. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5.</p>
                        <p>The Second ſinne of Seruants is to anſwere againe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and admonitions. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9.10.</p>
                        <p>The third ſinne is to reiect admonitions, to refuſe and to reſiſt the authoritie and corrections of their gouernours, as <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus. Gen.</hi> 16.6. Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, by fraud or theft to conuay away their maſters goods, or by negligence to become vnprofitable drones in their Maiſters ſeruice. Such were <hi>Zibah.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.4. and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> it is like before his conuerſion.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, to obay them in things vnlawfull, as when <hi>Sauls</hi> men refuſed to obay and ſerue their Maiſters tyranny, <hi>Doeg</hi>

                        <p>Thirdly, they muſt be men of courage, for his knowledge and experience cannot profit him, when hee is to performe and execute the duties of his calling, if eyther hee feare the rebukes of Superiours, or the hatred and reports of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.</p>

                        <p>Sixtly, they muſt hate all filthy gaine: and deſire of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and rewards: for rewards blinde the eyes of the prudent, and ſtop the eares of the righteous.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, theſe two Lawes following fitly follow one an other, firſt, for that the one is often the cauſe of the other: Adultry and Intemperancie breed many quarrels and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſecondly, for that Adultrie, or defiling of a mans wife is next in degree to the ſinne of Murther: thirdly, for that a heart full of compaſsion and loue, and a chaſt heart goe euer together. Againe, the Lord is large in the fiue former commandements, but ſhort heare: firſt, becauſe the light of nature is not ſo darkned in vs concerning theſe as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: therefore hee vſeth moſt words where moſt need is: ſecondly, for that wee are more hardly drawne to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the firſt Table: thirdly, for that the obſeruation of the firſt Table puts a new life into vs for the obſeruation
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4351:88"/> of the ſecond. The Heathen were very blinde concerning God: neither did they know the depth of theſe Lawes of the ſecond Table. Our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt is the beſt expoſitor and preacher of this Law, who himſelfe expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in theſe words. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21.22. <hi>Ye haue heard that it was ſaid vnto them of old time: Thou ſhalt not kill: but whoſoeuer killeth ſhall be culpable of iudgement: But I ſay vnto you, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is angry with his brother vnaduiſedly ſhall be culpable of iudgement: And whoſoeuer ſaith vnto his brother Raca, ſhall be worthy to be puniſhed by the counſell: And whoſoeuer ſhall ſay foole ſhall be worthy to be puniſhed with hell fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this expoſition of our Sauiour Chriſt wee may learne many things: but firſt generally let vs obſerue theſe two things.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, how hee doth taxe and reprehend the phariſaicall gloſſe and interpretation of this Law. Their interpretation was onely of the externall act of murther, ſaying, whoſoeuer killeth ſhall be culpable of iudgement: and this expoſition of externall murther, they vrge by authoritie of the auncients, ſaying, that thus the learned Fathers vnderſtoode this Law, ſaying, <hi>you haue heard,</hi> that is, by Scribes and Phariſes ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeate, <hi>by Auncients,</hi> that is, old Rabbies and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: <hi>culpable of iudgement,</hi> ſaying, whoſoeuer killeth witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or vnwittingly, willingly or vnwillingly, he ſhall bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and adiudged in iudgement, whereby is meant the inferiour courts of iuſtice which were kept in all parts of Iewrie: and here they did qualifie and corrupt iuſtice, and leſſen puniſhments often contrary to Law. Wee ſee by theſe few examples, how corrupt the iudgement was of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbines, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. and how Chriſt cals them back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Law and Prophets. Thus by degrees the Fathers ſince Chriſt fell from the Goſpell, at laſt came the Schoole men and ſet vp Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, hee giueth vs his owne true interpretation of the Law: where hee teacheth vs clearely, that there are three kinds of murther, worthy of three kindes of iudgements or
<pb facs="tcp:4351:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> puniſhments. Firſt, the murther of the heart, which is anger vnaduiſed: for all anger is not condemned: There is a Godly anger in chriſtian zeale, the whetſtone of fortitude: this murther to ſay no more is worthy your iudgement, that is, your correction and puniſhment yee doe inflict in inferiour courts: Secondly, the murther of the fierce countenance, with addicion of ſome fooliſh word in contempt, with an euill geſture and behauiour of countenance, mouth, tongue, head, hand or ſuch like. Now for this contempt of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith Chriſt, to ſay no more of this kinde of murther, it is worthy to bee puniſhed by a <note n="*" place="margin">This Court was for the greater offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: here he meaneth the synedrion in Ieruſalem a court of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie two iudges.</note> counſell, that is, in an open conſiſtorie, euen in your higheſt courts. Thirdly, the next kinde of murther (which the Phariſes and world count light and ſmall) is the murther of the tongue: whoſoeuer (ſaith Chriſt) ſhall reprochfully call his brother a foole, this man I tell you deſerues euen the torments of hell.</p>
                        <p>Wee ſee then by the words of the beſt interpreter what the ſcope of this Law is: namely, the preſeruation of the life and perſon of man: for this Law ſtriketh at the root of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, a ſinne deepely ſetled in the corrupt heart of man.</p>
                        <p>The meaning of this Law in few words is this. Thou ſhalt not any way greeue, offend or hurt thy neighbour in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, part or whole, ſoule or body: Neither ſhalt thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any dutie of mercy, or labour of loue, for the good, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, health, peace, and welfare and continuall preſeruation and ſaluation of thy neighbour, during life.</p>
                        <p>And that this interpretation muſt be of inward ſinnes as well as of outward (contrary to the Phariſes) the Diſciple teſtifieth with his Maſter ſaying:<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>He that hateth his brother, is a murtherer:</hi> And God being a ſpirit, his Law muſt needs be ſpirituall, for the reſtraining not onely of the hand, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the heart. Wherefore it is euident that in this Law, the Lord would cut downe all the cauſes, occaſions and ſecret roots of cruelty which grow in our corrupt nature. The Lord would haue our fallow ground plowed, and the ſecret thorns of hatred and mallice digged vp, for that theſe imbred euills
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4351:89"/> are deepely rooted in vs.</p>

                        <p>The ſpeciall ſinnes here condemned are theſe: either crueltie againſt our ſelues: firſt, ſoule murther, as to neglect thoſe things which concerne ſaluation: ſecondly to neglect thoſe things which concerne the temporall ſtate and health of body or minde: thirdly, actuall ſelfe-murther, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the heathen.

                        <p>
                           <hi>An.</hi> The firſt is inhumanitie and crueltie againſt any of the creatures, as againſt brute beaſts, all the euillvſage of them is here conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, this is one of the ſins of the laſt times. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. he that is cruell to beaſts will not ſpare the life of man when occaſion is offered, wee are commaunded to helpe our enemies aſſe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.6. Wee ſee this in <hi>Balaam,</hi> who in great rage would haue ſlain the poore Aſſe, when the Angell would haue ſlaine him and that moſt iuſtly, his heart is diſcouered in his bloudy counſell againſt Gods people, which <hi>Balack</hi> with all ſpeede put in practiſe. <hi>Num.</hi> 22. and 23. chap.

                        <p>Secondly, the Lord here condemnes all want of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care to preuent all dangers and euills which may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the life of man or beaſt, for this cauſe the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded battlements on houſes to preuent dangers, that men might walke ſafely on the houſe tops, as the cuſtome was in Iewrie. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.8. for this cauſe the goring Oxe muſt be ſtoned to death and not eaten. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28.30. And this is the Lords care in commaunding that no pits bee left vncouered. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.33. The ſame may be ſaid of rayling of bridges, and of the mending of high wayes that man and beaſt may trauell ſafely without feare.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, next there bee three branches or kindes of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie againſt our ſelues here condemned in this Law. And theſe muſt be firſt conſidered: for if the loue of man towards himſelfe be the line and rule of his loue towards other men: hee that is cruell to himſelfe can not bee mercifull to other men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1. Soule-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>Firſt, of this crueltie the firſt branch is Soule-murther:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4351:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> Soule-murther is when a man carks and cares continually for his carkaſſe, and neglects the ſtate and life of the Soule, his Soule lies dead in ſinne. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. and feeles it not, wants the life of God and hee knowes it not. There is a neceſſarie diet and foode for the Soule, which if yee neglect and denie, the Lord cries in his word that yee kill the Soule, or bee Soule-murtherers. <hi>Hoſh.</hi> 4.6. <note place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly, the ſecond branch of this crueltie againſt our ſelues, is when by any ſinne or ſinnes we bee enemies to our owne health and ſo to our life: and herein three ſpeciall kindes are condemned for that by experience they be found dayly to ſhorten the daies and life of man:<note place="margin">All intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy impaires health.</note> The firſt kinde is all intemperancy, which deuoures patrimonies, brings in all exceſſe, reueling and vncleanneſſe (for ſinnes be linked and grow vp together) what a number of filthie diſeaſes doth whoredome alone breed in men, according to the Apoſtles doctrine and the common experience? wherefore wee iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude againſt theſe ſinners, they are cruell and vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to themſelues for hearts bee eaten vp with this care: the ſecond ſecret enemy of a mans life, is that biting, eating, conſuming and diſtracting care, which Chriſt condemneth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. This care with the ſorrowes which follow it, be very euill, againſt this <hi>Salomon</hi> warneth vs ſaying. <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.22. <hi>a ioyfull heart cauſeth good health, but a ſorrowfull minde dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp the bones.</hi> The third ſecret enemy of a mans health, and life is an improuident care for foode and raiment, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſlouthfulneſſe, condemned. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.6. and 10.26. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 37.11.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the third kinde of crueltie againſt a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is the higheſt kinde of crueltie that can bee named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:4351:91"/> the naturall life,<note place="margin">Actuall ſelfe-murther.</note> and this is actuall ſelfe-murther, when a man laies violent hands on his owne life, and imbrewes his hands in his owne bloud. Firſt, ſuch bloudy executioners bee greatly iniurious to God and men. The Lord hath ſet forth ſuch in his word as terrible examples for all ages to behold, accounting them as monſters to terrifie all men from ſuch vnnaturall practiſes: as <hi>Saul, Achitophel, Iudas,</hi> and the like. Secondly, the godly in extreeme ſorrowes would neuer ſeek to end their paine on this wiſe as theſe did, for they were well aſſured ſuch an end was a beginning and the entrance into euerlaſting ſorrowes.<note place="margin">Here men muſt not reſpect the examples of Pagans nor any ſuggeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Sathan to the contrary.</note> 
                           <hi>Dauid</hi> rores for very griefe of heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> chattered as a Bird, and could not ſpeak for anguiſh of mind. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 38. <hi>Iob</hi> deſired to be ſtrangled. cha. 8.13. but they ouer came all their ſorrowes by the ſpirit of faith and patience. Thirdly, and laſtly, we be not our owne but Chriſts. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, in the fourth place we be to conſider of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all branches &amp; kinds of crueltie againſt other men, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this Law. And here the firſt kinde is the inward and ſecret murther of the heart,<note place="margin">Murther of the heart.</note> beecauſe this is the fountaine and head-ſpring of all the reſt: <hi>out of the hart proceed euill thoughts murther, &amp;c. Mar.</hi> 7.21. And vnto this kinde referre we all inward anger, wrath, malice, hatred, enuie, fretting, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, debate, grudge, deſire of reuenge, to bee fierce, heady, neuer appeaſed but a ſtoick in other mens harmes, and ſuch euils which breake the bands of loue. The Scriptures which condemne theſe ſecret ſinnes of the heart are theſe, <hi>Leu.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.15. <hi>He that hateth his brother is a man-ſlayer. Prou.</hi> 22.24.25. we bee forbidden to haue any familiaritie with, or to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an angry man, reaſon is giuen of this charge. <hi>Prou.</hi> 26.21. for the contentious man is apt to kindle ſtrife, as the cole the coles and wood a fire. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31. <hi>Let all bitterneſſe, anger and wrath, crying and railing be put away from you with all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſſe: and be ye mercifull, forgiuing one another, euen as God for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake hath forgiuen you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:4351:91"/>
                        <p>The Heathen do deſcribe and diſtinguiſh Anger, Wrath and Enuy, as followeth: Anger is the beginning of madneſſe:<note place="margin">Anger is a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hote boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the bloud in and about the hart which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees becomes wrath &amp; then ſeeks reuenge.</note> againe, Anger is the drunckennes or giddineſſe of the Soule. Wrath admitteth no good counſell. Anger is the roote of malice, murther and death. Enuie is a prying into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and gifts of other men with griefe of minde for our owne wants, a vice compounded of hatred againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Num.</hi> 12.10. and of ſelfe-loue.</p>
                        <p>Anger is not alwaies taken in the euill part. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26. but vnaduiſed, and exceeding, which without grace preuenting breeds wrath, hatred, fierceneſſe, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as we ſee in <hi>Cain, Saul, Herod.</hi> The ſpawne and ſeede of all theſe bitter and fowle ſinnes are in the hart euer ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and will neuer cleane out till the laſt day: for this cauſe Sathan finds it no matter of difficultie by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the mindes of the children of rebellion. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.3. to ſwell them with wrath and malice one againſt another, he proceedes in the worke in this order: firſt,<note place="margin">How Sathan kindles anger and wrath in men.</note> hee worketh in our affections a ſecret miſliking of men, and often for no certaine or knowne cauſe. Secondly, if wee miſlike, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beare at ſuch mens hands any thing wee can ſuffer in others: and ſo the fire of indignation begins ſecretly to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle within vs. Thirdly, Anger continued, without grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting and remedies applyed, burnes exceſsiuely and breaks out into hatred, fierceneſſe, wrath and mallice. Fourthly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and wrath are ſo fiery that they can hardly be quenched before they come to reuenge. Fiftly, deſire of reuenge brings murther.</p>
                        <p>Implacabilitie followes in a number of fierce mad men, for by degrees they become ſuch as can neuer be appeaſed: as the mad Iewes againſt <hi>Paul. Act.</hi> 21.31. and 23.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. Wherefore looke well to the firſt motions of anger in the miſliking or deſpiſing of any man in thine heart: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent all occaſions, and intertaine not, but fight againſt ſuch affections, for they are dangerous. Laſtly, for inward ſinnes the ſtoicks, are here condemned: which is not to be moued
<pb facs="tcp:4351:92"/> with any bowels of other mens. The carnall in his owne iniuries is quick, but cold and dead in the euills of other.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond kinde of externall cruelty, which Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. is the crueltie of the countenance, which appeares more or leſſe in the face commonly: or by the euill geſture &amp; cariage of our ſelues in any other part of the body.</p>
                        <p>This crueltie breaks forth firſt in the whole countenance: either fierie and fierce, or pale, trembling and caſt downe, as in <hi>Cain. Gen.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Why art thou wroth, and why is thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance caſt downe.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">This outward cruelty of countenance, hath killed many a man.</note> or by a ſcoffing flering face to greeue the heart of any man. The holy Ghoſt counts it very cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> againſt <hi>Iſaac. Gen.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Sarah</hi> ſaw <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſcoffing &amp; laughing ſcornefully, ſhe knew forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the malice of his heart, and therefore prouideth that both hee and his mother be caſt forth, out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, that is, out of the Church. Theſe ſcorners are grieuous ſinners before God. <hi>Prou</hi> 24.9. <hi>The wicked thought of a foole is ſinne, and the ſcorner is an abhomination vnto men. Pro.</hi> 9.7.8. <hi>Iudgements are prepared for the ſcorner, and ſtripes for the fooles back. Prou.</hi> 19.29.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, this cruelty otherwhiles is manifeſted in the eyes fiery and flaming which are common ſignes of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and drunkennes as the Lord himſelfe teſtifieth. <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.29.30. By this euill eye the rich ſcare away the poore. And therefore the Lord commandeth the lender not to looke on his poore brother with an euill eye. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.9.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this crueltie appeares alſo by the knitting and bending of the browes in a ſowre and lowring countenance. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.16. by wagging and ſhaking of the head and hands, gnaſhing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teeth, gaping of the mouth, thruſting forth the tongue. <hi>Dauid</hi> the liuely type of Chriſt complaines againſt this often. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.21. <hi>They gape on me with their mouthes, ſaying, a ha, our eye hath ſeene.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>gnaſhing their teeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee.</hi> And this crueltie was practiſed againſt Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.39. <hi>They that paſſed</hi> by his croſſe, <hi>reuiled him, wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their heads. &amp;c.</hi>

                           <hi>Chams</hi> ieſting brought a curſe on him and all his poſteritie. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Michol</hi> for ſcorning <hi>Dauids</hi> holineſſe was barren all her life. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23. The Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines ieſt and ſcorne the ſeruant of God <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to their owne ruine and heauie deſtruction. <hi>Iud.</hi> 16.30. <hi>Shemei<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Idolatrous men of Bethell taught their children to ſcorne the Lords Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> as hee paſſed by them: God ſmote them with a preſent plague, they were deuoured of wilde beaſts. So the Lord ſmote them to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to all ages how his fierce wrath is euer kindled againſt this ſinne.</p>
                        <p>To conclude the wittieſt kinde of ieſting which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then euen in Athens, did eſteeme and grace as a ſpecial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the Lord condemnes it as a groſe ſinne, and forbids it for euer vnto his people. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.

                        <p>Firſt, all bitternes of the tongue is here condemned, ſome men be ſo full of bitternes and fiercenes, that there tongues ſeeme to be dipped in the poiſon of Aſpes, or in ſome dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon. Theſe as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith. <hi>Prou.</hi> 12.18. <hi>ſpeake words like the prickings of a ſword, but in the tongue of the wiſe is health.</hi> Such mens tongues are whetted by euill ſpirits, and ſet on fire by the fire of hell: for ſo Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh. Chap 3. Of this ſect was <hi>Nabal</hi> as the wiſe ſeruant of <hi>Abagail</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, ſaying:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.14.17.</note> 
                           <hi>Dauid</hi> ſent meſſengers to ſalute our maſter, <hi>and he railed on them:</hi> now therefore take heede, for euill will ſurely come on our maſter, and vpon all his family, <hi>for hee is ſo wicked that a man cannot ſpeake vnto him.</hi> Of this ſect was railing <hi>Shemei</hi> who meeting <hi>Dauid</hi> in a tumultuous time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly curſed and cryed againſt the king that he was <hi>a bloudy and a wicked man.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.8. And of this followſhip was <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who is ſaid <hi>to be fierce, cruell, a bitter ſcorner with his tongue, and his hand againſt euery man, and euery mans hand againſt him. Gen.</hi> 16.11.12.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Curſing is here condemned: to bleſſe God and to curſe men are two contraries: and cannot poſsibly bee in one man as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth. Chap. 3.9. <hi>for that one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cannot ſend forth ſowre and ſweet,</hi> if thou canſt not bleſſe God, thou art no true worſhipper: if no worſhipper of god thou ſtandeſt in the ſtate of wrath and perdicion. The Deuill
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4351:93"/> in this man is let in and blowes hard on the coles of wrath. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.27.31. for this cauſe the Lord warneth often againſt this ſinne: and that his children be ready alwaies to bleſſe euen thoſe which curſe them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. Into this ſinne fell <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> vnder the croſſe, and in great paſsions of minde, but they repented with bitter teares. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.74.75. <hi>Iob.</hi> 3. and 42.</p>
                        <p>Preſeruatiues and rules againſt theſe Sinnes are theſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, By faith to beehold and conſider wiſely of Gods prouidence: So doth <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. let <hi>Shemei</hi> alone <hi>the Lord hath ſent Shemei to curſe Dauid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, pray for ſuch and doe them all the good thou maieſt: for ſo Chriſt commandeth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſe them that curſe you:</hi> and his Apoſtle teacheth the ſame leſſon. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>recompenſe euill for euill to no man, bleſſe I ſay and curſe not.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe practiſeth it, for when they curſed and railed he prayed for them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, take heed of the conceit of <hi>Balack,</hi> and of many blinde vnbeleeuers concerning <hi>Balaam,</hi> and wizards curſes: <hi>I know whom thou bleſſeſt is bleſſed, and whom thou curſeſt, hee ſhall be curſed. Num.</hi> 22. ver. 6. for thine vnbeleefe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked feares may cauſe the Lord to let Sathan looſe to ſmite thee, and then ſhalt thou faſten thine eyes on witches, and regard the words and deeds of lying ſpirits in theſe wicked inſtruments.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, againſt all the curſed ſpeeches of godleſſe men, remember the comfortable words of <hi>Salomon. Prou.</hi> 26.2. <hi>As the Sparrow and Swallow by flying eſcape, ſo the careleſſe curſe ſhall not come.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fiftly, and laſtly, remember how the Lord hath often turned the curſes of the wicked into bleſsings for his children as hee teſtifieth himſelfe hee did againſt <hi>Balaam. Ioſhua.</hi> 24.9.10.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4351:94"/>
                        <p>Thirdly, Slaunder is here condemned, as a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſinne of the tongue full of crueltie. It is diſcribed thus: <hi>A ſlanderer is one that walks about, ſeeking all occaſions to knit lyes together, and to broch them, maliciouſly intending to hurt a man in his perſon, goods or good name.</hi> The holy Ghoſt hath giuen vs a liuely deſcription of this ſinne in the examples of <hi>Doeg</hi> the Edomite, <hi>Haman, Zibah</hi> and ſuch like in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſinners may truely bee ſaid to bee the ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> for they notably reſemble their father in many points. Firſt Sathan is an <note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 1.6.7.8.9.</note> eſpie, ſo bee they. Secondly, Sathan is an <note n="b" place="margin">Zach. Reue.</note> accuſer, ſo bee they. Thirdly, Sathan is the <note n="c" place="margin">Io. 8.43.44.</note> father of lyes, ſo bee they. Fourthly, Sathan is malicious, ſo bee they. Fiftly, Sathan is bloudie, ſuch be they. Sixtly, Sathan <note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 2.2.3. Pſal. 101.5.</note> works ſecretly, ſo doe they. Seauenthly, Sathan is very ſweet in his temptations, full of ſugred <note n="e" place="margin">Iames. 1.13.14 Gen. 3 2.3.

                        <p>Rules for peace-makers are theſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, prouoke no man by word or geſture. Secondly, for peace ſake leeſe thy right. Thirdly, anſwere no man fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4351:94"/> Fourrhly, conſture all mens doings and ſayings in the beſt part, as much as thou canſt according to the rules of pietie and chriſtian charitie. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p>Actuall murther and crueltie hath many degrees and different kinds. Firſt, in regard of perſons, for the more bands of loue knit men together, the greater is the crueltie and ſinne committed: firſt, the higheſt degree is againſt Parents, Children, or Brethren: ſecondly, againſt any Chriſtian neere vnto vs for his faith and profeſsion, or louing friendſhip and neighbour-hood: thirdly, againſt any man: for the Image of God is to be reſpected in euery man. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in the forme and manner of proceeding in this action, theſe differences muſt bee reſpected. Firſt, There be ſome cloſe practiſes of crueltie, as either to conſent, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or command ſecretly the death of any man: as <hi>Saul</hi> in the death of <hi>Stephen. Act.</hi> 7.58. <hi>Herod</hi> for the Baptiſt. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. <hi>Ieſabel</hi> againſt <hi>Naboth, Dauid</hi> againſt <hi>Vrias.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.28. or to poiſon ſecretly any man: as Ieſuites do Princes, &amp; witches doe many, being taught by Sathan in their practiſes: or in iudgement ſecretly to peruert iuſtice for rewards, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great crueltie: This we ſee in wicked <hi>Felix</hi> againſt <hi>Paul. Act.</hi> 24.25. and 28. Secondly, ſome open actuall cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties: firſt, in the open courts of iuſtice and iudgement, to let the murtherer eſcape with his pardons or howſoeuer, this is great crueltie againſt the whole land: which muſt then beare the wrath of God for the ſinne of one man. <hi>Num.</hi> 35.16.33.34. Secondly, out of iudgement there are many kindes: firſt, againſt the liuing: ſecondly, againſt the dead. Crueltie againſt the liuing, is to take away the life of any, or to hurt or wound any man in body, or in ſoule. Crueltie againſt the dead, as not to burie the dead is a heatheniſh inhumanitie and a puniſhment for the wicked. <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.19. 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.8.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, concerning the murthering of parents, and children, the ſinne is ſo deteſtable, and againſt nature, that heathens being <note n="*" place="margin">Romulus.</note> demanded, wherefore they made no Law for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſuch ſinners, they anſwered: firſt, for that they
<pb facs="tcp:4351:95"/> thought ſuch euils could not be committed of any: againe the Heathen Iudges made a law, that a Snake, a Dog, a Cock, and an Ape ſhould bee bound together in a ſack with the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer and all caſt into the deepe ſea, for that they would haue no man once thinke of ſuch ſinnes, but with horrour and trembling. If theſe ſinners eſcape the hands of men, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reade or find, that they do eſcape the heauie iudgements of God: as wee ſee in <hi>Abſalon</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> they are ſet forth as memorable examples for all ages.</p>

                        <p>Loue or Charitie may well be deſcribed to be a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall grace or gift of God, proceeding from faith vnfained, and from a pure heart, kindled and wrought in vs by the ſight of the pardon of ſinnes, and the feeling of the loue of God ſhed into our hearts. Firſt, that it is a gift of God Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth. 1. Epiſtle. Chap. 4.7. <hi>Loue commeth of God, and euery one that loueth is borne of God, and knoweth God.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it reſteth in a cleane hart: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, ſaying. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Loue proceedes from a pure heart,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The commendation of this grace is great in Scripture.

                        <p>Thirdly, It is more profitable in the Church then any of the extraordinarie gifts of the ſpirit: as the gifts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, of ſtrange tongues, of healing, and ſuch like. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. ver. 8.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, it is an infallible teſtimonie vnto our ſpirits, we are tranſlated from death to life, <hi>if we loue the Saints.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.4.</p>

                           <note place="margin">1.

Of <hi>Putiphars</hi> wife it is ſaid <hi>that ſhee caſt her eyes vpon Ioſeph,</hi> and then began to luſt after him, and to entice him to lye with her. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.7.

                        <p>Here then are condemned all inticements of the eie, which ſtirre vp the heart to vncleane luſts: The moſt common and dangerous lures of theſe times are theſe following: Firſt, dead pictures of naked men and women, the old lures of the Diuell in paganiſme. Curſed <hi>Cham</hi> ieſted at his fathers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. And ſo the ſpirit of whoredome cauſeth men to delight in that which is one ſpeciall cauſe of ſhame and confuſion, for hee that delights in the effect will delight in the cauſe and occaſion. Sinne brought in ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vpon vs: our weakeneſſe, our ſhame, our frailtie, God hath taught vs to couer with our apparell.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4351:100"/> or dead pictures, follow the old Pagans in practiſe and ſet vp banners for whoredome and vncleannes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the ſecond lure is the banner of pride in coſtly and ſtrange apparell: the bleſſed voyce of God in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemneth in apparell two things: firſt, coſtlineſſe and waſting of our ſubſtance on apparell, aboue our ſtate, wealth, place and calling, wherein God hath placed vs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe places. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. with <hi>Eſa.</hi> 3. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2.3.

This is
<pb facs="tcp:4351:104"/> the ſinne for the which <hi>Ezra</hi> and the godly with him, ſo faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, mourned and wept. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.10. This ſinne is ſpecially named to bee the cauſe of the firſt deſtruction of the world by the floud in <hi>Noahs</hi> time. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.1.2.3. verſes. But wee finde the Iewes often to match with the Gentiles, and their mariages allowed of God: as <hi>Boaz</hi> to <hi>Ruth,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>Anſ.</hi> When the Lord gaue his Law againſt ſuch mariages: hee added this ſpeciall exception, that if they did renounce ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and did embrace his holy worſhip they might mary,<note place="margin">Deu. 21.10.14.

                        <p>Fourthly, againe the Lord here condemneth all ſtealing away of the ſonnes and daughters of men for mariages: and this is done two manner of waies:<note place="margin">Rape &amp; force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned.

Theſe and the like godleſſe practiſes haue crept into the Church from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme and Papiſme: for the Popiſh canoniſts abuſing the Lawes which were made againſt the enticeing and defiling of Virgins with conſent haue made ſtollen mariages lawfull.<note place="margin">Deut. 22.28. Exod. 22.16.</note> The very words of their cheefe Maſter, be theſe. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Parents for mariages is not of any neceſsitie, but ſerues to comlineſſe and honeſtie. But wee know the holy Lawes of the Almighty require this conſent in mariage, for the Lord giues the father this authoritie. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.16.17. for that children to parents are the moſt ſpeciall and deereſt part of that ſubſtance which the Lord hath lent them for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort on the earth; which thing the Diuell knew right well. <hi>Iob.</hi> Chap. 1 and 2. Againe, if children bee bound to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour parents in all things, moſt of all in this ſolemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which doth ſo much concerne their ſtate during life. Thirdly, this the Lord alſo teacheth by holy examples, which for this are commended as preſidents for all ages, as of <hi>Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Rebecca. Gen.</hi> 24.4.50. and the contrarie is no leſſe condemned in Prophane <hi>Eſaus</hi> mariages for the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all poſterities. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.8. and 27.46.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, Polyganie is here condemned: reaſons againſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4351:104"/> this euill are theſe following: Firſt, the Lords will is that his children in holy mariage conforme themſelues to the firſt preſident which he gaue in paradiſe. But then and there the Lord ioined one man &amp; one woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together in mariage, therefore this forme is to bee followed in the Church for euer. Secondly, the Lord hath giuen a manifeſt Law againſt this ſinne of hauing two wiues. <hi>Leu.</hi> 18.18. where in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall the words are thus read. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take vnto thee</hi> in mariage <hi>one woman to another,</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Malachie</hi> and Chriſt charge vs to looke on the firſt inſtituon of mariage and follow it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. The Prophets words are. chap. 2.15. <hi>And did hee not make one? yet had he abundance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and wherefore one? becauſe hee ſought a godly ſeed.

                        <p>Sixtly, Diuorcements whether Iewiſh or Chriſtian to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate againſt the manifeſt word of God are here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Summarily wee be commanded here as to endeuor
<pb facs="tcp:4351:105"/> and labour to keepe our owne ſoules and bodies in holines and honour, ſo alſo to preſerue, what lyeth in vs, the chaſtitie of our neighbour. And the deformitie and darkneſſe of the ſinnes beefore condemned, may helpe vs to ſee the beautie and brightneſſe of the contrarie vertues here commended, which are ſpecially theſe following.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, here wee be commanded to keepe the heart watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, well exerciſed in holy thoughts and godly meditations. Here let no man ſay with the blinde heathen, <hi>that thought is free for euery man:</hi> But contrarilie remember what the Lord warneth often, as <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keepe thine heart withall diligence, for from it proceede the actions of life.</hi> And againe. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Seing wee haue ſuch promiſes let vs clenſe ourſelues from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, and grow vp into full ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in the feare of God.</hi> And this hee teacheth by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. when he ſaith, <hi>Keepe your ſelues in your ſpirit.</hi> that is, keepe vnder and crucifie your affections and luſts, euen the ſecret motions and deſires of your hearts.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Lord requires the ſanctification of the whole man. 1. <hi>The.</hi> 5.23. <hi>The ſoule, ſpirit and body,</hi> for that all theſe parts are redeemed by Chriſt, therefore they muſt all bee kept holy and cleane.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, many not watching ouer their harts haue beene ſmitten with the ſpirit of ielouſie, and ſo of madneſſe, and ſo of crueltie, and murther, as wee ſee in <hi>Ammon</hi> and ſuch like examples. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the chaſtitie of all the ſences, is here comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and here a ſpeciall watch ouer the eye and eare is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: firſt, for the eye. An adulterous eye (as wee heard) fils the heart with vncleanneſſe, and ſo inflames the whole man: here then <hi>Iobs</hi> watch muſt bee remembred. Chap. 31.1. <hi>I made a couenant with mine eyes why then ſhould I thinke on a maide?</hi> And <hi>Ioſephs</hi> chaſt eyes and eares: for hee could not endure to heare and ſee the vnchaſt behauiour and words of his miſtreſſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Lord here commaunds vs to keepe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4351:105"/> watch ouer our lips, and tongue: The Chaſtitie of this member is noted with theſe marks.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, the chaſt tongue ſpeakes nothing but that which is poudred with ſalt, and that which is good to the vſe of edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and may miniſter grace to the hearers. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, to ſpeake with ſhame faſtneſſe and ſobrietie of thoſe things which ſinne hath couered with the garment of diſhoneſtie and vncleanneſſe, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Pſalme. This is the Apoſtolicall charge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3.4. <hi>Let no vncleanneſſe, or filthineſſe bee once named among you, as it becommeth Saints.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Sobrietie and Temperancie in all ſpeech. <hi>Iames.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.19. Contrary to this are the notes of the harlot: firſt, much babling. <hi>Prou.</hi> 7.11. ſecondly, Shee is loude.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the Lord here commands the chaſt and ſober cariage of the whole man: and of all the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: for like as the vnchaſt behauiour of any part of the bodie argues a filthie and vncleane perſon: ſo the ſober, graue, and holy vſe of all the outward parts commends and declares the chaſtitie of the heart howſoeuer vncleanneſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and hypocriſie may bee couered vnder the viſion of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britie. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2.3.4.5.6. <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome ſay albeit they bee not cleane tongued, and fingred yet they bee cleane harted. <hi>Anſ.

<pb facs="tcp:4351:106"/> ordinance for the propagation of a holy ſeede, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.14. commended in all the old &amp; new Teſtament in the examples of all the Patriarches, Kings, Prieſts and Prophets: in men of all degrees and condicions of life.</p>

                           <hi>Obiect.</hi> Firſt, but ſome teach that mariage doth rather pollute and defile a man then keepe him chaſt. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is the voice of Antichriſt, who is contrary to Chriſt, as in all his proceedings ſo in this: Contrarilie wee bee to remember what the ſpirit of Chriſt hath propheſied of our times, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. that falſe teachers ſhould come and diſgrace holy mariage, and reiect it as an vncleane thing, but wee are to hold ſuch doctrine to proceed from the Diuill.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">This ſcripture hath beene much abuſed by Tatianus, Montanus, Tertullian, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them by Hierom and Nazianzen.</note>
                           <hi>Obiect.</hi> Secondly, but ſingle life is preferred before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not for any holineſſe or puritie in this kinde of life, but for an outward and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect: for the Apoſtle ſo ſpeaketh, commending the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. ver 26. <hi>for the preſent neceſſitie,</hi> becauſe of the manifold afflictions of thoſe times, and the paucitie of true chriſtian beleeuers, leaſt they ſhould marrie with vnbeleeuers which was a thing moſt dangerous and contrarie to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge of God vnto all his people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obiect.</hi> Thirdly, it is further obiected in our wretched times, that marriage breeds beggerie and hurts the good ſtate of the common wealth. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Neither pouertie nor riches can commend or diſcommend any holy ordinance of God, let the lawes and rules of God, and godlineſſe be kept, that euery man labour in a lawfull calling, that all idleneſſe and diſordered life be baniſhed, and expelled from among Gods people. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore man maried ſhal be bleſſed in the Church of God as well as the rich, and as for the moſt part as daily experience teacheth vs, more comforted and bleſſed in his wife and children. Of this point Maſter <note n="*" place="margin">The Martyr.</note> 
                           <hi>Hooper</hi> ſpeaks on this manner. <hi>They be worthely condemned, that for pouertie, fooliſh vowes, or for eaſineſſe of life refuſe matrimonie, and tarrie in the preſent danger of fornication, &amp; of the concupiſcence of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4351:106"/> fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Laſtly, the old Pagan Romaines commended ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the pooreſt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the ſecond barre, and preſeruatiue of a chaſt life, in temperancie and ſobrietie in meates and apparell: how profitable this vertue is at all times, and how needfull, alſo the religious faſt and abſtinence is, for the humbling of our ſoules and bodies, as often as wee bee called and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned hereunto, all wiſe men know and haue euer teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with God and his word in all ages. And contrarily how fulneſſe of meates and exceſſe in apparell doe ſo carry men headlong into all looſeneſſe, that they cannot bee contained by any good meanes within the bounds and lyſts of a chaſt life.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the third barre and preſeruatiue of chaſtitie is prayer: This is ſuch a holy worke of the ſpirit of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in vs, as can neuer proceede from vs vnto God, nor returne vnto vs with comfort, but when the heart is puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, and our whole bodie and ſoule, and ſpirit bee kept as chaſt veſſels of holineſſe and honour to ſerue the liuing God. So that prayer preſerues chaſtitie, and chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie fits and helps vs vnto prayer.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the fourth barre of a chaſt life is the ſocietie and companie of the faithfull. This the Apoſtle ſheweth ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>flee luſts of youth, &amp; follow after righteouſnes faith,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.22.</note> &amp; loue and peace,</hi> how this may be done is intimated in theſe words, <hi>keepe with them which call on the Lord with a pure heart.</hi> And of this <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Prou. 13.20.</note> 
                           <hi>he that walketh with the wiſe ſhall be bleſſed, but a companion of fooles ſhall bee afflicted.</hi> Of this the Pſalmiſt warneth vs by his owne example. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I am a companion of ſuch as feare the Lord.</hi> And wee bee often charged at no hand to conuerſe with the wicked,<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1.</note> leaſt we be tainted by them, for he that toucheth pitch can not be vndefiled: and a ſpeciall prohibition is giuen vs to auoid the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of all vnclean perſons. <hi>Ep.</hi> 5.3.4.5. where the Lord aſſuring vs that ſuch haue no portion of inheritance with Chriſt in his kingdome, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth <hi>be not therefore compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

                        </p>
                        <p>Fiftly, the fift barre and preſeruatiue of a chaſt life is to trauell and labour in a calling allowed of God. How dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous idlenes is, peſtring the Church and common wealth as with many groſe ſinnes, ſo with the ſins of whoredomes and adulteries in ſpeciall manner, was before ſhewed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily the continuall labour of an honeſt calling, doth ſo exerciſe body and minde and the whole man, that ſuch men, ſpecially hauing taſted of godlineſſe, and hauing put on Chriſt, can not ſo eaſily be baited, when occaſion is offred: neither <hi>doe they take ſuch thought as the Idle man for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts of it.

                        <p>Fiftly, inquire whether thou haſt beene infected with the lures of vanitie to fill thine eares with adultrie: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haſt taken any delight in reporting and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring thine owne or other mens vncleane practiſes, filthie, vnſauerie, wanton and whoriſh ſpeeches, amorous lookes &amp; ſongs: if thy conſcience plead guiltie, this Law condemnes thee.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, it is an euill ſigne of an vncleane and irreligious hart. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.21.22.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is an enemie to the word for it makes the hart vtterly vnfit to entertaine and retaine the holy word of God. <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.14. Therefore the Prophet cryeth. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.36. <hi>Lord incline mine hart to thy teſtimonies and not to couetouſnes.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, it is the cauſe often of our want of our inward peace of conſcience, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57.17. <hi>For his wicked couetouſnes

                        <p>Seauenthly, the Apoſtle forgets not to warne the Churches carefully againſt this ſinne. The Church of Rome: Chap. 1. 29. The Church of Corinth. 1. Epiſtle. 6.9.10.

                        <p>Firſt, all fraude in ſelling to ſell the badde for good: as they did in <hi>Amos</hi> time the refuſe of the wheate, for the price of good corne. <hi>Amos.</hi> 8.4. Let not the greedineſſe of thine affection, but the goodneſſe of the thing thou ſelleſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected that thy gaine may bee reaſonable: and that thou maiſt ſell good for good, meane for meane, and refuſe for refuſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in buying to vſe any deceitfull words to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

                        <p>Thirdly, all deceit in falſe waight, meaſures, colours,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.13. Leu. 19.35.36.</note> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows &amp; lights, are here condemned, for very theft. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Whatſoeuer yee would that men ſhould doe vnto you, ſo doe yee vnto them: for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> I doe not loue my brother when I take from him more then I ſell him, that is, more then my wares bee worth: for in buying and ſelling men come, as it were, to the ſpoile of a Citie, where euery man catcheth and ſnatcheth and carrieth away all that he can come by.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, all ſecret practiſes of Ingroſſers and Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: they ſtore vp in their owne houſes all commodities and goods which they can finde of one kinde, that they may ſell the ſame to their brethren at what rate and price they pleaſe. There were ſuch in <hi>Nehemias</hi> time. Chap. 5. but that good Prince cauſed them to repent and to deale more mercifully with their brethren.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, all fraude and vnmercifullneſſe in letting houſe, lands, beaſt, &amp;c. as by racking of rents, ouerprizing euery thing, for to raiſe and increaſe the hire without all compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the poore.

A generall rule for all Contracts is this, that wee ſo deale herein with our brethren, as that wee bee ſeene to haue faith towards God and loue towards men.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, Theft alſo is ſecretly committed in the contracts of giuing: The giuer giues his gift with purpoſe that it ſhall be euer his to whom it is giuen, herein men ſinne againſt this Law. Firſt, when they giue waſtfully and prodigally any

                        </p>
                        <p>The ſeauenth and laſt kinde of ſecret theft in Contracts here condemned, is in lending taking for vſury, and giuing for intereſt.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, for taking for vſurie, or for the vſe and for the lone of any thing lent: if there bee not a damnable ſecret Theft committed againſt this Law in the Contract of lending, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vſurie, then in vaine hath God giuen his Law againſt it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. In vaine did the Prophets and Expounders of the Law threatten for this kinde of ſinne. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. Chap. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. In vaine doth God require of his children a mercifull lending vnto their knowen, religious &amp; needy brethren. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. <hi>Luke.</hi> 6.35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.42.</p>
                        <p>In the blinde papacie there was none in this Land did practiſe vſurie, but vnbeleeuing Iewes; nor to this day in the Popes dominions any dare profeſſe this practiſe, for if any bee iudicially found in this ſinne, he ſhall neither be perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of their Sacraments, nor be buried in their burying pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if hee dye without repentance, that is (ſay they) without reſtitution.</p>
                        <p>The Pagans abhord this ſinne as the very bane of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. And leaſt any here doubt what this ſinne is, howſoeuer ſuch as liue in it, can neuer be ſatisfied: yet this is cleare that the Lord deſcribes this ſinne on this manner,<note place="margin">Exod 22.29.

                        <p>Theft in giuing for vſury, or for the loue of money to vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers is here condemned. The wicked in borrowing are noted: firſt, they borrow not for want, but to ſatisfie their luſts. Secondly, They pay not againe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.21. Thirdly, they borrow of Vſurers. If thou borroweſt of Vſurers, firſt, thou art in bondage to a bloody and vnmercifull man. <hi>Prou.</hi> 22.7. Secondly, thou canſt not bee free from contention, and a miſerable life. <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.10. Thirdly, thou muſt gaine vniuſtly, to make an vniuſt payment to the Vſurer.

                        <p>Thirdly, to liue by magicall arts, as all Sorcerers, &amp; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians doe, is a very impious kinde of theft: of this kinde an example is giuen vs. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. ver. 16.

                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Idleneſſe belongs to this kinde of inordinate life: a very ſecret and dangerous kinde of theft, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many fowle ſinnes. This ſinne is againſt Gods gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall decree of labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>Secondly, to walke in the obedience of this Law, we muſt labour to finde our hearts and mindes contented with that which wee haue in preſent poſſeſsion, reſting in it as in a rich portion with thankfulneſſe: euer bearing our port and countenance in all our doings accordingly, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding whatſoeuer, for if once our affections ſhall ouerflow the banks of our owne condition, ſo that in minde we burne

                        <p>Secondly, this is a pollicie of Sathan, to lay before vs the great benefites which wee want to cauſe vs to murmure for them, &amp; to diſgrace the preſent benefits which we haue, leaſt wee ſhould be thankfull.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Lord oftentimes giueth his children no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen riches, but his promiſe made vnto them, which they muſt wholy depend vpon, vntill the Lord ſeeing them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the thing in the Teſtament beequethed vnto them, ſhall in wiſedome giue them their legacies.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If we can not reſt in the fauour of God though we want outward things, it is certaine that wee neuer truely eſteeme the fauour of God: and thoſe neuer felt truely the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, which hauing it can not bee content to forgoe other things, wee muſt then learne to reſt in the fauour of God whatſoeuer it bringeth with it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Lord here requireth of vs that with all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and truth, and iuſtice, wee giue euery man his owne right, endeuoring the preſeruation of the goods of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as of our owne.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by what kinde of ſtealth or iniury, or vniuſtice, by word or deed howſoeuer wee poſſeſſe the goods of other men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is here commanded.

                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 144. And how many waies doe men outwardlie yet ſecretly diſgrace their brethren?</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Principallie theſe three waies: firſt, by reueling their ſecrets. Secondlie, by fooliſh ieſting. Thirdly, by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and fained coulored ſpeeches: ſoothing men in their ſinnes againſt God and men.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, for reueling or diſcouering of ſecrets to the diſgrace of thy neighbour, the Lords iudgement of ſuch a one is this: hee wants loue, and vnderſtanding, faithfulneſſe and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he reſpects neither God nor man. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. If loue couer a multitude of ſinnes, it is a badge of an euill heart to diſcouer a few infirmities. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Loue beleeueth all things, hopeth all things. Prou.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Hee diſpiſeth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> in reuealing his ſecrets, <hi>is deſtitue of Wiſedome: but a man of vnderſtanding will keepe ſilence: he that goeth about as a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer diſcouereth a ſecret, but he that is of a faithfull hart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeth a matter.</hi> The curſe of <hi>Cham</hi> for this ſin may be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for all ages. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for fooliſh ieſting to the diſgrace of other men is here condemned. This ſinner for that he greeues much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearts is a very murtherer as is before ſhewed in the ſixt Commandement. <hi>Sarah</hi> could not beare that ſcornefull <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> in one houſe with her good Sonne <hi>Iſaack. Gen.</hi> 21. And <hi>Michol</hi> ſhee loſt <hi>Dauids</hi> heart by her fooliſh ieſting. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:4351:117"/> 6.23. Many proud wits and vaine harts ſeeke praiſe for their pleaſant conceits and ieſting to the ſhame and greefe of others.</p>
                        <p>Preſeruatiues againſt this euill are theſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Prayer: <hi>The mouth of the wicked, and the mouth full of deceit are opened vpon mee, they haue ſpoken to mee with a lying tongue: They compaſſed about mee alſo with words of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred &amp; fought againſt me without a cauſe, for my friendſhip they were mine aduerſaries, but I gaue my ſelfe vnto prayer. Pſal.</hi> 109.3.4. Againſt ſuch hee prayeth inſtantlie. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining. ver. 15. <hi>The abiects aſſembled themſelues againſt mee, and I knew not they tare mee and ceaſed not: with the falſe Scoffers at bankets gnaſhing their teeth againſt mee.</hi> ver. 21. <hi>And they gaped on mee with their mouthes ſaying, Aha, Aha, our eye hath ſeene.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Conſolation by meditation in the word. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. ver. 23. <hi>Princes alſo did ſit and ſpeake againſt mee: but thy Seruant did meditate in thy Statutes.</hi> ver. 51. <hi>The proude haue had me exceedingly in deriſion, but I remembred thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of old and haue beene comforted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, remember thy Maiſter and Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt: they railed, they reuiled, they mocked him euen in his paſsion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.39.40.41. and hee endured. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3.</p>
                        <p>Thirdlie, ſmooth, ſoft and flattring ſpeeches to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our brethren in their ſinnes are here comdemned: for in ſo doing wee hurt their credit and eſtimation with God and his people. <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.6. <hi>The words of a friend are faithfull, but the kiſſes of an enemie are to be deteſted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This euill worme of adulation eates vp the hearts of the fooliſh, as wee ſee in <hi>Herod</hi> aduancing himſefe. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.22. after the vaine applauſe of the people. But intollerable and moſt pernicious is it in the Miniſters of Chriſt, who for their owne gaine, glory and bellies ſake handle the word of God
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4351:117"/> deceitfully, with ſweet word, preaching peace to the wicked. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.13.14. <hi>with faire ſpeech and flattering, deceiuing the harts of the ſimple. Rom.</hi> 16.18.</p>

This ſinner is well deſcribed to <hi>be one that walkes about ſeeking all occaſions to broch a falſe report intending thereby maliciouſly the hurt of any man.</hi> Againe, this ſinner in many reſpects reſembles Sathan: hee is a <note n="a" place="margin">Io. 8.44.</note> Lyer, he works <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 101.5.</note> priuately, with ſoft <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 52 4. 2.

Examples for this ſinne are <hi>Doeg</hi> the Edomite, <hi>Zibah</hi> the falſe and vnfaithfull ſeruant of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> the accuſers of Chriſt, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>Preſeruatiues againſt theſe biting Dogges are theſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Praier, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. and 35. Secondly, an holy affiance and truſt in God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. Thirdly, the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.1. and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the ſecond enemie of a mans name and credit, the marchant of tales or a tale-bearer, is here condemned: The Lord giues his people a great charge alſo concerning
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4351:118"/> this ſin. <hi>Leu.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not marchandize tales, or walke about with tales among the people.</hi> Againſt theſe complaines the Prophet, ſaying of Ieruſalem. <hi>In thee are men that carry tales to ſhed blood. Ezech.</hi> 22.9. This ſinner beſtirres himſelfe much, hee frequents manie places, and is acquainted with many perſons. Hee doth no ſoner ſell in one place his old commodities, but foorthwith in another hee ſtores himſelfe with new. Theſe marchants are of ſundrie formes: Some come whiſpering and ieſting ſecretly to the diſgrace of other men: as curſed <hi>Cham</hi> diſcouering his Fathers nakedneſſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. Some come glozing and peruerting the words of men: as where as Chriſt had ſayd <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Deſtroy yee this temple and I will build it in three dayes,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his bodie: the malicious Iewes report his words on this wiſe: This fellow ſayd <hi>hee could deſtroy the Temple of God and build it againe in three dayes. Mat.</hi> 26.61. vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his words of the materiall Temple of Ieruſalem, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ſpake not a word.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, he that loues, likes, and intertaines lies and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is here condemned: as alſo. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 15.3. and <hi>Re.</hi> 21. &amp; 22. Chap. Vnto theſe ſinners the Lord ſpeaketh by his Prophet ſaying, howſoeuer they cloke themſelues in his Tabernacle the viſible Church on earth, they ſhall neuer reſt (without repentance) in that mountaine of God in heauen. And where as hee chargeth vs in his Law, ſaying <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.1. <hi>Thou ſhalt not receiue a falſe tale, neither ſhalt thou put thy hand with the wicked to be a falſe witneſſe,</hi> hee teacheth vs that to intertaine, or to conſort our ſelues with liers and ſlanderers and ſuch like wicked men, is the way to ſeduce vs to the damage and great hurt of our brethren by falſe teſtimonies in open courts of iuſtice.</p>
                        <p>Againe, the holy Ghoſt expounds this Law ſaying. <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.4. <hi>The wicked giueth heede to falſe lips, and a lyar harkeneth to the falſe tongue:</hi> where hee brandeth him that loues and receiues Lyes with theſe two marks, firſt, hee is <hi>an impious man,</hi> next, <hi>hee is a Lyar,</hi> for hee that beleeues Lyes muſt of
<pb facs="tcp:4351:119"/> neceſsitie vtter and ſpeake Lyes. And further hee warneth in the ſame Chapter. ver. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt keepe thee farre from a lying ſpeech,</hi> a ſpeciall reaſon is added, <hi>ſlay not the innocent and righteous;</hi> as if the holy Ghoſt had ſayd: If thou receiue Lyes, thou muſt at one time or another giue falſe teſtimonie againſt the life and blould of thy brother. This we may ſee in practiſe: for <hi>Saul</hi> as ſoone as hee receiued <hi>Doegs</hi> falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, he did not onely conſent, but alſo command the death of eightie iuſt and holy men. And when <hi>Dauid</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Zibahs</hi> calumniation againſt his Lord and Maſter <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth,</hi> it was the loſſe of that good mans lands, and neere hand of his life.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, conſider it well that like as this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of tales talkes of other men freely in thine houſe, ſo hee will ſpeake as largely of thee with other men. <hi>With what meaſure you mete to others, it ſhall be meaſured to you againe. Mat.</hi> 7.1. Wherefore be aduiſed by <hi>Salomon</hi> how to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all ſuch kinde of gueſts. <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.23. <hi>As the North winde driueth away the raine, ſo doth an angry countenance the ſtandering tongue.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Sirach. 11.7.</note> It is a ſhame to anſwere before wee heare, and ſo to beleeue before wee knowe a certaintie. <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.13.</p>

                        <p>It plainly appeareth by this Law, that the loue
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4351:122"/> of God and of our neighbour, and not ſelfe loue is the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Commandements: and that hee liueth beſt and moſt holy, that (ſo much as may bee) liueth and traueleth moſt for the good of other men: and that no man liueth worſe and more wickedly, then he that liueth and traueleth moſt for him ſelfe.</p>

                        <p>Secondlie, what this Law condemneth and commandeth. The tenth Law firſt, condemneth in vs: firſt, our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as vncleane and accurſed. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. for that wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together polluted with that originall corruption, which by propagation hath ouerſpred and infected all man kinde. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.

<pb facs="tcp:4351:123"/> that corruption, which hath poyſoned our whole nature, or be iniected into vs by Sathan or bee kindled by Sathan and our owne fleſh both conſpiring (as it were) for our perdition: Thirdly, for the want of originall iuſtice and integritie.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it commandeth vs, firſt, to labour with God, and in all the holie meanes he hath giuen vs for a pure and cleane <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. 1.15. 1.

                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 150. Now proceede to giue vs a more ſpeciall and cleare ſight of the firſt euill condemned in this Law.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, here I ſay then, that this Law condemnes our verie nature as vncleane, and that hitherto the Lord hath by the former Lawes but cut downe the branches, now he ſmites downe the roote, and whole bodie of ſinne.</p>
                        <p>That our whole nature is infected: Firſt, God himſelfe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, whoſe ſpirit in his ſeruants ſpeakes on this manner. <hi>Iob.</hi> 14 4. <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of filthineſſe.</hi> And againe. Chap. 15.14.15.16. <hi>What is man that he ſhould bee cleane, and hee that is borne of a woman that he ſhould be iuſt. Behold he found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his Saints: yea, the Heauens are not cleane in his ſight: how much more is man abhominable, and filthie which drincketh iniquitie like water.</hi> And againe, thus hee teſtifieth of mans nature. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>We are all by nature the children of wrath. Iewes and Gentiles,</hi> that is, all men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, without any exception of any, but onely of the immaculate Lambe the Sonne of God, Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly the holie Saints of God haue found this true by their owne experience beeing enlightned by a ſupernaturall grace, for they profeſſe and confeſſe that there is nothing by nature good in them. <hi>Dauids</hi> experience and confeſsion is this. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was borne in iniquitie and in ſinne hath my mother conceiued mee. Pauls</hi> experience and confeſsion is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4351:123"/> this. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I know that in me, that is in my fleſh,</hi> or nature <hi>dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Maſter <hi>Hooper</hi> the Godly Biſhop and Martirs experience and confeſsion in this, in his holy praiers in the dungeon he ſaith. <hi>O God, euen Hell it ſelfe is in me,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his very nature was helliſh, and prone to follow Sathan. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I anſwere that God here condemnes all the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane motions, thoughts, and deſires wee haue vnto ſinne, albeit our hearts neuer conſent nor ſubſcribe vnto them. The minde of man is euer full of motions, and the heart of affections, as the Sea, neuer at reſt. Where wee muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed that wee are not here to vnderſtand all fanſies, and dreames which are in the head: but thoſe onely which being before in our mindes, bite and ſtrike alſo the heart with luſt: for wee neuer wiſh for any thing wee affect, but our heart is ſtirred vp, and leapeth therewithall, giuing inwardly, ſome ſignes of ioy in the poſſeſsion and vſe of that wee deſire. Here then the Scripture principally condemneth the heart of man as the very fountaine and head-ſpring of all vncleane and euill thoughts. <hi>Ge.</hi> 6.5. <hi>All the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart are onely euill continually.</hi> Againe. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue all things who can know it?</hi> Againe, Chriſt teacheth vs. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.21. <hi>that out of the hart of man proceed euill thoughts,</hi> and how much theſe firſt euill motions to ſin diſpleaſe god, howſoeuer men thinks thoughts bee free, attend his owne words. <hi>Prou.</hi> 12.2.<note place="margin">Prou. 21.27.</note> 
                           <hi>A good man getteth fauour of the Lord, but a man of wicked thoughts will he condemne.</hi> To this agrees well Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Simon Magus. Act.</hi> 8.21.22. <hi>Pray God that if it be poſſible the thought of thine hart may be forgiuen thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The author of that Apocriphal booke, called the booke of Wiſedome Chap. 1.3. ſaith, <hi>that wicked thoughts ſeparate from God.</hi> And ver. 5. <hi>that the ſpirit of God withdraweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the thoughts that are without vnderſtanding.</hi> And ver. 9. <hi>Inquiſition ſhall bee made for the thoughts of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4351:124"/>
                        <p>And here wee ought euer to remember what great euill follow theſe firſt motions vnto ſinne: for if they be not ſlaine in the breeding they will grow vp like Serpents and in time poyſon and bring euerlaſting perdicion on the whole man, for this cauſe the Apoſtles forewarne vs of theſe ſecret and hidden ſeedes of ſinnes deceitfulneſſe, that if wee ſuffer our ſelues to bee caried away by them from God, then Sathan will lay ſo many baites and traps for vs, that he will cauſe vs to entertaine them, and (as it were) to conceiue and wax big with ſinne. <hi>Iames.</hi> 1.13.14. and then theſe deceiuable luſts will breake forth ſo dangerouſly that our hearts being once ſoftned by grace,<note place="margin">Principijs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, meet with a miſcheefe in the beginning.</note> ſhall againe be hardned by ſinne, which is moſt perillous, for few returne after ſuch relapſe but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on (without Gods ſpeciall grace preuenting them) from euill to worſe to their owne endles deſtruction both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſoule. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12.13.</p>
                        <p>Againe, whereas theſe ſpeciall examples are here ſet downe of Houſe, Wife, Man, Maid, Oxe, Aſſe: We muſt bee warned, that the Lord hath ſet downe theſe for that at all times, and in all places wee feele theſe to ſtirre in vs, and to deſire (as it were) to kindle in vs: wherefore our charge is foorthwith to quench this flame of luſt, and not ſuffer our hearts to bee poſſeſt with any ſuch motions, but ſo often as they offer themſelues in ſight to reiect them as vncleane greefes.</p>
                        <p>And here for our better inſtruction concerning this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent argument: wee bee taught of God that there are three kindes of motions, which touch and ſtirre our hearts often. The firſt is an inſenſible impreſsion, which Sathan in a ſtrange maner (which we can hardly conceiue nor perceiue at the firſt, much leſſe expreſſe) breath or iniect into mens hearts. This kinde of motion the naturall man doth embrace as the motion of his owne heart, yea otherwhiles albeit his iudgement and conſcience fight againſt it, yet his heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines it and likes it as wee ſee in <hi>Iudas</hi> betraying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:<note place="margin">Iohn. 13.3.4.</note> hee knew hee was moued to betray innocent bloud in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4351:124"/> iudgement, yet Sathan ſo preuailed with his heart and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that hee ceaſed not till he had brought forth the mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſter which his heart conceiued.</p>
                        <p>This kinde of motion doth much diſquiet Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for that they feare much it is a ſerpent of their owne broode, and next for that they haue within a great fight of the ſpirit againſt it. But the Godly howſoeuer hereby they haue iuſt cauſe to be humbled, to fight ſtrongly, and to pray inſtantly againſt ſuch monſters, which Sathan ſeeks to faſten on them: yet they are not to bee diſmaide ſo long as they feele their iudgement, conſcience, heart, and affections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect ſuch motions: For I haue knowne ſome godlie perſons, euen in their fleſh and whole bodie to tremble at theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet not able to recouer and to be freed from them for a long ſeaſon, and to grone and mourne at the ſight of ſuch euils ſtirring in their hearts. The beſt of the Saints of God haue neede otherwhiles that Sathans meſſenger bee ſent vnto them not to kill, but to cure them leaſt they bee puffed vp and poiſoned with ſpiriturall pride. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond kinde of motions which ſmite the heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from our owne inherent corruption: Theſe the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate doe obſerue, and albeit they tickle the heart with the lures, baites and pleaſures of ſinne, yet by grace they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and reiected. And yet by this Law the Godly be here taught to bee humbled, and to obſerue well what a hidden puddle and vnſauery ſincke of corruption and vncleanneſſe they carry about with them, which ſends foorth and fomes continually ſuch vncleane matter, euen in the preſence of the moſt mightie God the ſearcher of all hearts. This humbled euen the holy Apoſtle, for he cryeth againſt his corruption, ſaying. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me from the body of this death.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>Secondly, we bee here charged of God to loue and ſerue God with all our heart, with all our minde, with all our thoughts,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.5.

                        <p>The Examination of the Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, inquire what ſight, what knowlede, what feeling, thou haſt had in former times of thy naturall corruption, for Hypocrites and Iuſticiaries thinke all ſure, and a good while they conforme their outward actions to the Law of God If thou haſt neglected, not knowne, not regarded the ſecret power of ſinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> and of that Law of thy members (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh) rebelling againſt the Law of thy minde: thy conſcience pleads guiltie and this Law condemnes thee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, inquire what ſecret motions againſt God and his Lawes, what vncleane thoughts, what vaine imaginations haue carried away thine heart from God, or haue poſſeſt euen thine heart the very ſeate of God: how they haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted and diſtracted thine heart: if thy conſcience pleads guiltie, this Law condemnes thee.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, inquire how often beeing lured by Sathan and ſinne thou haſt beene carried away as it were from God to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4351:126"/> any ſecret conference and parling with the Diuell to ſtir and kindle in thee any vncleane luſts: if thy Conſcience pleads guiltie, this Law condemnes thee.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, inquire what the excellencie and beautie was of thy firſt creation, and how by their apoſtacie, our firſt parents loſt the ſame: and how thy ſelfe art but a branch of that accurſed ſtocke of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore art by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the child of wrath no leſſe then others: and therefore for the want of that originall iuſtice and excellencie of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God by this Law may in iuſtice condemne thee.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, inquire further whether finding thine hart ſo euill affected, and thy ſelfe ſo addicted to ſinne, and in ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bondage to Sathan, whether thou haſt (I ſay) ſought vnto Chriſt to bee purged and healed of thy running ſores, or rather when Chriſt hath cryed in thine eares,<note place="margin">Prou. 1.

                        <p>Sixtly, inquire with what inward affections and loue thou haſt ſought the good of thy neighbour; for if in procuring his good thou haſt labored but in the outward, as is for forme ſake, and to bee ſeene of men, and not with inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: thy conſcience pleads gultie, and this law condemnes thee.</p>
                        <p>Seauenthly, inquire what holy thoughts, what Godly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, what profitable and pertinent diſcourſes of minde concerning God and Godlineſſe thou haſt: how thou haſt diuided thy times, reſeruing a good portion dailie for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of godlineſſe, to bee ſpent ſpecially in holy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and praiers: for if theſe holy exerciſes bee wanting, thy conſcience pleads guiltie, and this Law condemnes thee.</p>

Of theſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets teſtified they ſhould haue an end and ceaſe at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, for wee neede not the picture when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is preſent. <hi>Daniell.</hi> 9.27. The complement of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie wee ſee in the practiſe of the Apoſtles. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. and ver. 28.29. And the Apoſtle aſſureth vs, they were but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of things to come, and the bodie or ſubſtance of them was to bee found in Chriſt.<note place="margin">Heb. 7 and 10.

                           <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.

                        <p>The morall Law is not abrogate nor neuer ſhall ceaſe to the worlds end. The curſe onely annexed thereunto is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to all ſuch as are found to be in Chriſt, for there is no condemnation to any one of them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith wee are freed from the Law and bee vnder grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Hee doth plainely, expreſſe himſelfe that hee meaneth not that wee are exempted from the obedience of the Law morall, but onely from the curſe of it, for ſo hee ſpeaketh. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt hath freed vs from the curſe of the Law, for that hee was made a curſe for vs.</hi> And as touching our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie obedience to it. This is the end of all Gods fauours vpon vs,<note place="margin">1.

But how a man may ſerue and pleaſe God in the obedience of this Law? the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, <hi>in and through Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> more diſtinctly: in the true ſeruant of God theſe things are required: firſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.

                        <p>Secondly, if after grace receiued, this man fall to ſinne againſt God, hee muſt recouer the former ſtate againe by renuing his repentance beefore that in any worke hee can pleaſe God.

               <p>The ſecond kinde of common faith is the temporarie faith which goes a degree further then the hiſtoricall, which is to profeſſe the Goſpell but without ſenſe of the power of it, or loue or liking to it, this faith may proceed yet to a great reioycing and to ſome barenly fruite, and yet is it but falſe and temporarie: firſt, beecauſe it neuer is of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, for in the heate of afflictions it vaniſheth away: and it is grounded on temporarie cauſes: firſt, a light, vaine deſire of knowledge: ſecondly, praiſe of men: thirdly, on riches and earthly preferments, the common motiue of liking or diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of religion with this kinde of men, the grounds of this faith then being vaine and vaniſhing, this faith therefore ſoone vaniſheth away.</p>
               <p>The third kinde of common faith, is the faith of miracles, when a man grounding himſelfe on ſome ſpeciall promiſe or reuelation from God, doth beleeue that ſome ſtrange and extraordinarie thing, which he hath deſired or foretold ſhall come to paſſe by the worke of God.

               <p>This ſmall beginning and weake faith, becauſe of weake knowledge in the miſterie of ſaluation, doth at the firſt yeeld aſſent to the truth of all Gods written word, deſiring to gaine more knowledge and to liue ſincerely according to the meaſure of knowledge &amp; grace receiued: this faith I ſay, may well be called as yet an implicite faith, becauſe it hath much folding and doubting: but being well exerciſed and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the meane of grace and knowledge, preaching, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, praier, meditation, conference, vſe of the Sacraments, ſinging of Pſalmes, mercifulneſſe to the poore &amp;c. growes vp in time to bee a ſtrong Faith.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I ſay thus much in effect that according to the meaſure of knowledge and grace recieued, I profeſſe that I reſt my ſoule vpon euery truth and promiſe which
<pb facs="tcp:4351:134"/> God hath giuen vs in his word concerning him or my ſelfe and my ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I know, profeſſe, and am perſwaded that the true God, three in perſons one in ſubſtance is my God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I profeſſe that my whole affiance and truſt is in this God alone, and that I haue wholy giuen vp my ſelfe vnto him to bee taught by his word, to bee redeemed by his Sonne, and to bee ſanctified and grouerned by his holie ſpirit. Here it is cleere, firſt, that ignorant people cannot make any true profeſsion of Faith, albeit they repeate the Creed ten thouſand times: for the beleeuer muſt haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> this the Apoſtle teſtifieth ſaying, <hi>how can they beleeue in him of whom they haue not heard, how can they heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Preacher?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if this bee true that to beleeue in God requires a holy affiance in God, I muſt looke well to it, that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſoule and body, and all things I haue vnto Gods prouidence and cuſtodie, this wee bee commanded by word and example: by word. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3.4. <hi>Truſt in God, do good and commit thy way vnto the Lord and truſt in him.</hi> Againe. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit their ſoules to him in well doing, as vnto a faithfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> As a friend truſteth his deare friend with his beſt things, ſo muſt wee commit our very ſoules vnto Gods cuſtodie.

               <p>Thirdly, if to beleeue in God bee to reſt vpon his word and promiſes: then muſt I looke well how much I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and truſt and haue reſpect to his word ſo much is my faith and beleefe in God.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I take it in this Article I may well expreſſe my meaning and Faith on this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I beeleeue in that God who is the Father of Ieſus Chriſt by nature, and my Father in Chriſt by adoption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I beleeue that God the Father of Chriſt, and my Father in him, is <hi>Almightie,</hi> the ſoueraigne Lord of Lords which hath all power and authoritie in his owne hands.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I beleeue that God the Father of Chriſt, and my Father in him is the <hi>maker of heauen and earth,</hi> and ſo conſequently, the preſeruer and vpholder of all things.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Father of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, firſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the true God and falſe Gods.</note> for this title (the Father) doe not adde this word to the former without a diſtinction, for the father is not God onely, but God is the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt. If any man would conceiue in minde rightly of the diuine nature of God, hee muſt conceiue of God, or of his diuine eſſence ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely: if hee would conceiue and meditate of any of the perſons, hee muſt thinke and conſider of the ſame relatiuely with perſonall proprieties,</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4351:135"/>
               <p>Here ſome haue doubted becauſe the Father is ſet in the firſt place, whether the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt haue their beginning of the Father. The anſwere is, the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt haue not a beginning of their nature, or of their diuine eſſence of the Father, but of their perſon one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the perſon of the Sonne is from the Father by an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting gouernement, and of the holy Ghoſt is from both by an euerlaſting proceeding: but the diuine eſſence of theſe three perſons is vncreate, vnbegotten, and proceeding from none.</p>
               <p>And wee muſt remember to hold faſt this miſtery of the Trinitie, firſt, that wee may diſcerne this true God from all falſe Gods: Secondly, that wee may conceiue in our mindes rightly of God,<note place="margin">We can haue no faith in the thing which is vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.</note> euen as hee hath manifeſted himſelfe in his word: Thirdly, and it is not ſufficient to Saluation to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God confuſedly, but we muſt beleeue that God the Father is our Father, God the Sonne is our redeemer, and that the holy Ghoſt is our comforter and ſanctifier. And we muſt not worſhip the Father without the Sonne and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, nor the Sonne without the Father and the holy Ghoſt, nor the holy Ghoſt without the Father and the Son, for then wee worſhippe an Idoll of our owne braines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.</p>
               <p>The firſt perſon in Trinitie is called a Father in reſpect of nature and of grace: firſt, by nature in reſpect of his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, next by nature, for that all things that are,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> haue their being and mouing in him and for him. Next, hee is a Father in reſpect of grace, beecauſe hee doth adopt and accept all the Elect for his children in Ieſus Chriſt: firſt, God the Father begets the Sonne before all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie: Sonne and the Father equall in time, but in naturall generation the Father is before the Sonne. Secondly, God the Father committeth to the Sonne his whole affaires, ſo doth not, nor can the earthly Father, but hee ſhould come to nothing. Thirdly, hee begets the Sonne in himſelfe and not without.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the Diuell is no more our Father. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.44. but wee haue a prerogatiue by our Faith in Chriſt to bee Gods children. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a moderate care will ſerue for the things of this life: for if I bee a child in Gods familie, the heauenly father will not faile mee: for I know that in a familie the Father prouideth for all. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6.7. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Your heauenly Father knoweth all your wants.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, if God bee our Father his loue is immutable, albeit wee bee changed euery day, yet hee is euer the ſame. <hi>Iames.</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if God bee our Father wee may freely come to his preſence continually, and acquaint him with all our greefes. <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.13. and if wee call inſtantly for the beſt things hee hath in ſtore, yea euen for his holy ſpirit, he will graunt our requeſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Almightie. 2.

               <p>Frſt, albeit thou haſt beene a grieuous ſinner and of long continuance in ſinne, yea, in moſt groſe and vile ſinnes: yet this great God is moſt able and all ſufficient to looſen by Ieſus Chriſt all the works, and power of Sathan, if thou wilt

               <p>Secondly, this is a ſingular conſolation in all the troubles of this life, that I am thus perſwaded in mine hart that God is my louing Father,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.4. Pſal. 23.4.</note> and an <hi>Almightie</hi> Father, moſt ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (as hee is willing) for good in all reſpects. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.29.</p>
               <p>The third title <hi>Maker of heauen and earth.</hi> And here I ſay this much in effect,<note place="margin">3. Difference betweene the true God and falſe: As. Eſay. 45.6.7.</note> that I know by the light of Gods word, and am perſwaded in mine heart by the work of Gods ſpirit, by whoſe grace I profeſſe and confeſſe that the true God, which I ſerue, is hee which created heauen and earth in the beeginning, which preſerueth and vpholdeth heauen and earth, and all things therein to this day, and ſhall doe it to the worlds end: diſpoſing alſo of all things euen the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which the heart of man can thinke vpon in any of his creatures, according to his owne moſt holy will and wiſdome. For I doe not now imagine (as ſome heathens haue done) that God ſtirs and moues the world by an vniuerſall motion, but alſo cheriſheth, careth for, and ſuſteineth euery thing by a ſingular prouidence. And this is that I profeſſe in theſe words.</p>
               <p>Here it may be doubted firſt, that it is ſaid the father hath made all things, ſeeing it is certaine, the Sonne and the holie Ghoſt did ioyne in this worke?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, theſe words of the Creed ſtand diſtinctly thus: I beleeue in that true God, which is Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt, ſecondly, which is Almightie: thirdly, which is Creator of heauen and earth,</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be doubted: if he hath created all things, then ſurely hee hath decreed all things: if hee hath decreede of all things how then comes in ſinne into the world?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> God doth not ſimply will or decree ſinne, but in part and with reſpects. Firſt, not as it is ſinne, but ſo farre forth as ſinne is either a puniſhment, chaſticement, tryall, action, or hath being in nature. Secondly, God can ſo vſe euill inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4351:136"/> that the work done by them, being a ſinne, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe in him bee a good worke, becauſe hee knowes how to vſe euill inſtruments well, as <hi>Iudas, Pilate, Cayphas,</hi> and the reſt in crucifying of Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the bleſſed Trinitie made heauen and earth in the beginning of nothing, onely by a <note n="*" place="margin">Pſa. 148.3. Gen. 1.3.</note> word ſpeaking: it may bee demanded what this word was?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The word of God in Scripture is taken three waies: firſt, for the ſubſtantiall word which was before the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this is Chriſt. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.1. Secondly, for the ſounding, or written word of God in the Scriptures. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> for the powerfull word of God, which is nothing elſe but the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, will and appointment of God.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Comfortable meditations vpon this point of the Creation of the world.</head>
               <p>Firſt, the doctrine of the Creation, and meditation in Gods works is commended often: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.148.</note> 
                  <hi>The works of God ought to bee ſought out of all them which feare him.</hi> And the skilfull workman thinks himſelfe much diſgraced to haue men paſſe by and not to reſpect his work: So is it with the Lord when his people paſſe by this meditation, this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth much for inſtruction and conſolation, for in the works of God wee may ſee Gods power, wiſedome, loue, mercie, prouidence. And how greatly God reſpecteth this, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in that he appointed this as a ſpeciall ſeruice done vnto him in the ſanctification of the Saboth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when I ſay I reſt vpon the Creator of heauen and earth: it yeelds vnto mine heart a ſpeciall comfort thus: God will aſſuredly keepe me in all dangers, for like as no man is ſo tender ouer any work as hee that made it, for hee can not abide to ſee it any way abuſed.<note place="margin">Iob. 10.3.</note> So God being a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creator tenderly loues all his Creatures.

                  <p>Thirdly, the terrors of an euill conſcience in malefactors argues plainely that there is a prouidence of God, reſpecting and gouerning all things: for if conſcience can ſo finde out a ſinne, and ſo torment a man, as <hi>Nero</hi> after hee had murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his mother, and <hi>Iudas</hi> after hee had betrayed his maſter, how much more ſhall God the Lord of the conſcience finde out all things. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.20.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The words firſt are to be read thus: <hi>And I beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> to the laſt words, <hi>ſhall come to iudge the quicke and dead:</hi> for all this portion is concerning Chriſt and our faith in him: Where wee may obſerue generally.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, his titles foure in number: firſt, Ieſus: ſecondly, Chriſt: thirdly, his onely Sonne: fourthly, our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, his natures: firſt, diuine, very God, for <hi>the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne of God, conceiued by the holy Ghoſt:</hi> ſecondly, humane: <hi>Borne of the Virgin Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his offices: firſt, hee is Chriſt the king anointed by his Scepter to rule ouer all: ſecondly, hee is Chriſt the anointed Prieſt by his death to ſaue <note n="*" place="margin">Elect.</note> all: thirdly, hee is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4351:138"/> Chriſt the annointed Prophet by his Goſpell to teach all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the great worke of our redemption by him wee are to note: Firſt, his ſuffrings and humiliation, and in it three degrees: firſt, his death: ſecondly, his buriall: thirdly, his deſcention into hell. Secondly, his glorious exaltation, and here are three degrees: firſt, his Reſurrection: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Aſcention: thirdly, his Seſsion at the right hand of God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of the title Ieſus: when wee adde the words,<note place="margin">1. An excellent confeſsion.</note> 
                     <hi>I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Ieſus,</hi> wee make profeſsion and confeſsion that wee know, beleeue in, and reſt vpon Ieſus Chriſt: And this is an excellent profeſsion, and to it belong great <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 16.16. Act. 10.43.</note> promiſes of things temporall and eternall. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.1.</p>
                  <p>But firſt here when I ſay <hi>beleeue in Ieſus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Wherefore I am thus to beleeue.</note> I haue good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to ſay and ſo to doe: firſt, for that I finde my Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt to bee God euerlaſting of the ſame ſubſtance and eſſence with God the <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 1.14. Heb. 1. Ioh. 10.</note> Father, and God the holy ghoſt. Secondly, becauſe the father commandeth <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 2.12.</note> me to loue him, and beleeue in him. And ſo the Sonne himſelfe expoundeth his fathers <note n="c" place="margin">Io. 6.40.</note> charge, adding this alſo that to <hi>beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> is the very worke of God in our hearts. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.29.</p>
                  <p>This name Ieſus was for good cauſe giuen him of his <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 1.21. Luke. 1.31.</note> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Angell rendreth the reaſon when hee ſaith, <hi>for he ſhall ſaue the people from their ſinnes.</hi> And there is none other Sauiour, neither ought ſaluation to bee ſought in any other. True it is that <hi>Ioſhua</hi> was ſo called, becauſe hee was a liuely type of this Sauiour in leading Gods people to that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reſt in Canaan. So are godly Princes, Prophets, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters called <note n="e" place="margin">Obadiah. ver. 21. 1. Tim. 4.16. 3.

                     <hi>Sauiours,</hi> becauſe they are Gods inſtruments both for temporall deliuerances, and eternall ſaluation. But Ieſus Chriſt is truely ſo called and properly, beecauſe hee ſaues Iewes and Gentiles, his elect of all nations, by his owne onely merits actiue and paſsiue in his life and death: and for that hee applies by his holie ſpirit the vertue of his death and reſurrection vnto euery one of his elect in his good time, both to crucifie and kill the power of ſinne in them, and to
<pb facs="tcp:4351:139"/> quicken them to ſerue him in all holineſſe and righteouſnes, and to cheere their hearts in all euils of this life. So then hee is the onely true and perfect <note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.31. Gal. 5.4.</note> Sauiour, and iuſtly ſo called.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, by this faith alſo muſt euery beleeuer bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted all his life. It is the greateſt matter of conſolation in this life that wee haue, that whereas wee meete continually with afflictions in this life, yet this cheereth our hearts wee haue a Sauiour, which is faithfull and mightie and who will keepe vs vnto his euerlaſting kingdome. This is that faith which cheered <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, and all the beleeuers from the beginning.

Luke.</hi> 2.10.11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the papiſts and wizards and Exorciſts which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe this holy title and name of Ieſus in their holy water, and exorciſmes, and coniuracions doe greatly blaſpheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this holy faith in Ieſus Chriſt: becauſe they doe relie (as their diuels teach and perſwade them) vpon the bare name of Ieſus, abuſing it in their practiſes: as thoſe Iewiſh exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts did in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, <hi>They tooke in hand</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luke) to name ouer them which had euill ſpirits the name of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſaying we adiure you by Ieſus whom Paul preacheth.

                  <p>This title of <hi>Anointed</hi> among the Iewes was giuen onely to three kinds of callings, Kings, Prieſts and Prophets.<note place="margin">This title giues three callings.</note> Now for that this one bleſſed perſon is called, ſent and anointed of his Father a King to rule all, a Prieſt to make expiation for all that ſhall bee ſaued, a Prophet to teach all: therefore iuſtly and truly is hee called for his excellencie <hi>the Chriſt, the Lords anointed.</hi>

And albeit this bee hard to ſet forth the forme and maner of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet wee may ſafely ſpeake with the Scriptures, that the ſonne is the <hi>brightneſſe of his glory,</hi>

                     <hi>and the ingraned forme of his ſubſtance:</hi> And with the godly Auncients, <hi>that the Son is of the Father as light of lights, not proceeding but begotten.</hi> So this generation is by an vnſpeakable communication of the whole eſſence of the Godhead of the Father to the Sonne: in receiuing whereof the Sonne doth no more diminiſh the maieſtie or godhead of the Father then the light of one torch or great light, doth the light of an other from which it is taken.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the Incarnation of the Sonne of God, wee muſt know that it is a great <note n="*" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note> miſterie and therefore here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, who is Incarnate? the ſecond <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 1.14.

               <p>This I obſerue touching this incarnation of Chriſt, that his conception by the worke of the holy Ghoſt was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for it was ſo done in the wombe of the Virgin, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit hee tooke of her very fleſh which came of ſinfull <hi>Adam,</hi> yet was the fleſh of Chriſt, I meane his humane nature bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule without ſinne.

                  <p>Firſt, a dutie following this faith is this: thankſgiuing for the Incarnation of the Sonne of God, as wee ſee by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Angels praiſing God for this benefite. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.14. the Virgin praiſing God for this benefite. <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.46.

                  <p>Secondly, a conſolation following this faith is preached vnto vs by the Angell. <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.10. when hee ſaith, <hi>Beehold I bring you tidings of great ioy that ſhall bee to all people:</hi> hence comes, firſt, peace with God: ſecondly, peace with our owne conſcience: thirdly, with the holy Angels: fourthly, with all the creatures of God in the frame of heauen and earth.</p>
                  <p>The proper name of Chriſts mother was <hi>Mary,</hi> this is teſtified often in the New Teſtament. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.5. &amp;c. This name is added for a more certaine and ſpeciall diſcription of his Mother, that my faith may bee the better certified of the truth of all diuine Oracles and Prophecies concerning him:<note place="margin">A double diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent among Iewes naturall by generation, legall when one ſucceed an other in the inheritance, being next by.</note> for this holy woman being (as <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) of the noble raſe of the kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> it is cleere that our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt came of the ſeed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and ſo of Abraham according to the promiſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and 49. <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <p>And this bleſſed mother of Chriſt a holy <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 1.48.</note> Prophetiſe, wee doe willingly honour her three waies, firſt, by thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing to God for her: ſecondly, by a reuerent eſtimation of her: thirdly, by imitation of her excellent vertues.</p>
                  <p>And thus hauing ſeene by cleere euidence from the Lord, that our bleſſed Lord and Sauiour, as touching his natures, is very God and very man: it reſteth onely that we learne alſo by diuine demonſtration that theſe two natures are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one perſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">2. Kindes of Vnions. 1. In nature. 2.

Vnion in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is when two things are in that manner vnited, that they make but one perſon or ſubſtance: as the body and ſoule of man meeting together make one man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this vnion of natures then here is this: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in Trinitie, or the Sonne of God doth aſſume to it a man-hood in ſuch order that the ſame being void of all perſonall being in it ſelfe doth wholy and onely ſubſiſt in the ſecond perſon in Trinitie, or depends wholy on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sonne: ſo that now it is a nature onely and not a perſon, becauſe it doth not ſubſiſt alone as in other men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this then I vnderſtand and beleeue here,<note place="margin">The vnion of natures diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> that the euerlaſting ſon of God, without any putting off of his diuine nature, without any commixtion or conuerſion, was made that which before his Incarnation hee was not, to wit, very man by taking fleſh by the power of the holy Ghoſt from the Virgin, and an humane ſoule created of nothing,<note place="margin">Perſonal vnion</note> both which natures being vnited together in a moſt admirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall vnion, make one moſt bleſſed perſon, euen the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred perſon of our onely Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1 Chriſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and fit Mediator.</note>Firſt, I vnderſtand and conceiue hee is a moſt fit Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to his Father being very God, and a moſt comfortable Mediator for me, beeing very man well acquainted with all my greuances, and one I may boldly draw neere vnto. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.17.18. and 4.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conceiue alſo that hee hath beene ſo acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our fleſh with our temptations, that he hath a ſpeciall experience of our infirmities in his owne ſacred perſon:<note place="margin">2 Chriſt had experience of our infirmities</note> not that the Sonne of God had need of our affections and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to make him mercifull vnto vs, but for that we can beſt perſwade our ſelues of his mercy when we learne that hee hath beene acquainted with our paſsions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 29. Tell me now breefly what meane you by the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4351:146"/> properties of the humane and diuine nature: and by the communication or coniunction of properties?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> When I ſay and beleeue that Chriſt did aſſume all the eſſentiall properties of mans nature, I meane hee tooke not onely the ſoule and body of man, but alſo euery qualitie and adiunct thereunto appertaining (excepting ſinne) for he had the vnderſtanding, the reaſon, the will and all the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of man (without ſinne) being <hi>made like his brethren in all things. Heb.</hi> 2.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, againe when I beleeue and ſay,<note place="margin">Chriſt doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtill all the properties of his diuine nature.</note> that Chriſt did retaine in this perſonall vnion of both natures, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of his diuine nature, I meane theſe and the like, that hee was, this very perſon now, God and man, <hi>Eternall, Almightie, Incomprehenſible, Immutable, moſt Perfect,</hi> for theſe and the like bee the properties of the diuine nature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> the communication of theſe properties (as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines ſpeake, for the better vnderſtanding of ſome Scriptures vttered concerning this ſacred perſon) it this, when wee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe that which is proper vnto one nature vnto the other, becauſe of the aforeſaid perſonall vnion of both natures: as when the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>God hath purchaſed the Church with his owne bloud.</hi> This maner of ſpeaking is with reſpect to this vnion, and herein that which is proper to the humane nature is aſcribed vnto the diuine: for that this ſacred perſon which did this great worke with his owne bloud is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God.</p>
               <p>But here wee bee alſo to obſerue that there is no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the eſſentiall properties of theſe natures, but in concreat only (as Logicians ſpeake) not in the abſtract, as we may ſay truely, and according to the doctrine of Godlineſſe, that <hi>God dyed for vs,</hi> but wee may not ſay therefore, <hi>the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dyed for vs.</hi>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 30. Tell mee yet more ſuccinctly, what diuine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, haue you to ſhew the neceſsitie of this, that our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt bee very God and very man, and that theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt thus admirably bee vnited together, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb facs="tcp:4351:147"/> ſo pure?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, breefly for the firſt: hee muſt bee very God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Chriſt our mediator muſt be very God.</note>Firſt, becauſe hee had receiued a charge from his Father (which did require an infinite power) to wit by his merits and vertue to ſaue the elect, for it was needfull that his price ſhould ouer-priſe our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if hee had not beene very God, hee could not haue ouercome death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that it behooued him alſo to ouercome and kill ſinne and death in vs, euen in our conſciences. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24.25. and to quicken vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. by giuing vs the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of faith to apprehend all his merits, and to apply the ſame vnto our ſelues. Now who can giue the holy Ghoſt but God himſelfe. <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, hee was to looſen and to deſtroy all the accurſed works of<note n="*" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.7.8. Mat. 12.2. Chriſt our bleſſed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator muſt be very man.</note> Sathan in vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and for the ſecond point hee muſt be very man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that God might declare his vnchangeable iuſtice, and hatred of ſinne, and his inſpeakable loue and mercie to the elect: the firſt hee ſheweth in puniſhing ſin in his owne Sonne: the ſecond hee declareth in that hee puniſheth not our ſinnes in our ſelues but in an other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that we might conceiue rightly of the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection of our Mediator towards vs: <hi>and how that hee which ſanctifieth and they which are ſanctified are all one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that God had confirmed it with an oth that the Meſsias ſhould come of the loines of <hi>Dauid. Pſal.</hi> 133. and 89. and of the ſeed of the woman according to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached in the beginning in paradiſe. <hi>Gen</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the third poynt this I beleeue and auouch breefly that ſaluation could not haue beene obtained for man, vnleſſe the nature of God and man were vnited together in one perſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe otherwiſe this work had not beene perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the bloud of the Sonne of God, and ſo it had beene inſufficient for vs.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:4351:147"/>
               <p>Secondly, beecauſe the humanitie of Chriſt could neuer haue borne that puniſhment for ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Saluation thus obtained could neuer haue beene maintained, but that theſe natures bee thus knit together: for that Chriſt is and muſt bee the pledge of our reconciliation for euer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.44.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by this meanes we haue as it were kinred with God, in Ieſus Chriſt, who is become our <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with vs, or God manifeſt in our fleſh. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for the fourth and laſt branch of the queſtion I ſay and beeleeue that it was neceſſary that our Lord and Sauiour ſhould bee pure, without the ſtaine of ſinne in his conception, and that the holy Ghoſt in this great work did ſo prouide.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for that the moſt glorious and diuine nature of God could neuer elſe bee vnited vnto the humane.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that a ſinner could neuer haue beene accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make this attonement or to offer vp any ſacrifice for ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that hee could not haue ſanctified others, vnleſſe hee were the moſt pure and the moſt holy one of God in himſelfe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. and Chap. 10.9.10.</p>
               <p>Thus then the Lord Ieſus Chriſt our moſt bleſſed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath taken to himſelfe of the whole maſſe of mankind being wholy infected and poyſoned with ſinne, hee tooke, I ſay, one portion thereof, and did perfectly ſanctifie it, by the power of the holy Ghoſt, and out of it deriues perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſanctification vpon all his elect, by imputation of his merits for their iuſtification, and by his holy Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them inherent righteouſneſſe and ſanctification that ſo they may ſerue him for euer in this life and for euer.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, as concerning his ſuffrings in generall, I beleeue hee wanted not paſsions all his life, from the houre of his birth vnto his death, and this that Euangelical Prophet foretold by the ſpirit of prophecie. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 53.2.3.4.5. <hi>He hath neither forme nor beautie: when wee ſhall ſee him, there ſhall be no forme that wee ſhould deſire him.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hee ſuffred in all his life many ſorrowes, in his natiuitie and infancie nakedneſſe and pouertie, as in the whole courſe of his life on the earth, hee ſuffred Sathan to tempt him, hee was <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> hungrie, hee was <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> thirſtie, hee was wearie: hee ſuffred many indignities and reproches, by the Iewes and <hi>Herod,</hi> by the Scribes, Phariſes, and Saduces, for all the Iewiſh ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Rabbines were ſet vp, as by the Diuell to ſhoot their arrowes againſt him.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 32. Deſcend to this ſpeciall Article: <hi>Hee ſuffred vnder Pontius Pilate:</hi> why doe you ſo beleeue: what was this Iudge and what did he?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I ſo beleeue, becauſe the Lord hath ſo recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Euangeliſts his paſsion. <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.14.15. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.14.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching this Iudge it is certaine that he was the Romaine Emperours <note n="*" place="margin">Luke. 3.1.</note> deputie for that Prouince in Iewrie where Chriſt was crucified. Hee did proceed with Chriſt in forme of Law as men are handled in Courts of iuſtice for capitall crimes: hee was cited or apprehended, hee was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned before <hi>Pilates</hi> tribunall ſeate, his indictment read, and proued by falſe witneſſes, which were accepted for good, after this <hi>Pilate</hi> gaue ſentence of death, and laſtly, execution was done accordingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how came it to paſſe that the ſame Iudge ſhould pronounce him innocent and yet condemne him as an euill doer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The firſt was done by Gods determitate councell, that Gods Elect might euer ſee it, that their Redeemer dyed not for his owne ſinnes: notwithſtanding hee was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as an euill doer by the ſame eternall decree and counſell of God, becauſe hee was to beare the iniquities of the Elect, and to make full ſatisfaction for the ſame.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4351:149"/>
                  <p>Herein then this is the meditation I haue by Faith: I do by faith beehold the Lord God himſelfe exerciſing iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the mouth of <hi>Pilate.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt is ſet himſelfe beefore the tribunall ſeat of God here on earth loden with my ſinnes, ready to receiue the ſentence of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to beare the wrath of God due to me for my ſinnes: for hee put himſelfe in our perſon as a wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, before this tribunall ſeate: and <hi>Pilate</hi> pronounced the ſentence of God vpon him (hee thinking nothing leſſe) for that ſentence was ratified by God in <note n="*" place="margin">2.

<pb facs="tcp:4351:150"/> but not in Chriſt.

                  <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, wee bee here to obſerue the long and weariſome combat hee had alſo with his bloudy enemies the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Sathan in all that conflict: firſt, the maner of the apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion: They came to take him as a theef with ſwords &amp; ſtaues. <hi>Lu.</hi> 22.52.

Thirdly, in the high Prieſts houſe they ſmote him with a reed on the face, they blindfolded him, they mocked him, &amp; ſmiting him they ſpake ſcornfully, <hi>prophecie who ſmote thee. Io.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.64. &amp; they condemned him in their Counſell, &amp; ſent him bound to the ſecular power, or ciuill Magiſtrate. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.28. Fourthlie, bloudy <hi>Pilate</hi> hauing acquitted him, yet to pleaſe the Iewes hee ſcourgeth him. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.1. Fiftly, to fill him with reproches, contempt and paine, as an Vſurper of the kingdome, they platted a crowne of thornes vpon his head. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19. ver. 2. and to the ſame purpoſe they put on him a purple garment, ſaluting him ſcornefully, <hi>Haile King of the Iewes. Iohn.</hi> 19. ver. 3. Sixtly, <hi>Pilate</hi> againe to gratifie <hi>Herod</hi> ſent him to him, and hee with his Souldiers deſpiſed him, and mocked him. <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.11. Seauenthly, all this toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and harrying to and fro was after his precious body was ſcourged and ſore wounded all ouer, and his head bruſed and rent with thornes. Eighly, and laſtly, they put vpon his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4351:150"/> body, his croſſe wheron hee ſhould bee crucified vnder which burthen hee fainted. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.26. And thus the Sonne of God was tryed by the prince of darknes, with all kindes of extreeme paſsions that hee could inuent in that ſhort ſpace of time before his Croſſe. Thus I ſay Iewes and Gentiles crucified him: firſt, the Iewes they kept him all night in <hi>Caiphas</hi> hall, and at the breake of day gathered a councell, and did proceede in iudgement againſt him and condemned him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.1. and forth-with lead him bound to <hi>Pilate:</hi> and hee made as quick a diſpatch as they.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 35. Proceed to ſpeake of the next Article of the paſsion of Chriſt, which is concerning his execution, in theſe words: I beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>crucified?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> All the Euangeliſts teſtifie with one accord that this was the forme of his execution hee was crucified on a Croſſe, and to fill him with paine, his hands and feet were faſtned with nayles vnto the croſſe. And all this was done to accompliſh Gods eternall decree manifeſted beefore by the Prophets. The braſen Serpent was a picture of this.<note place="margin">Act. 3.18. Gal. 3.1. Phil. 2.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 21. <hi>Io.</hi> 3. for ſo hee ſaith himſelfe. <hi>As Moſes lifted vp the Serpent in the wilderneſſe, ſo muſt the Sonne of man bee lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp, that all that beleeue in him periſh not, but may haue life euerlaſting.</hi> And againe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>And when I ſhall bee lift vp from the earth, I will draw all vnto my ſelfe:</hi> of this the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt prophecied ſaying, <hi>they peirced my hands and my feete.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that wee might in conſcience bee reſolued that Chriſt came vnder the Law and ſuffred the curſe thereof for vs,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> and bare in his owne body and ſoule the extremitie of the wrath of God for vs. And albeit other puniſhments were notes of Gods curſe, yet was the death of the croſſe in ſpeciall manner aboue the reſt accurſed, by vertue of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commandement, and ſpeciall word pronounced by God himſelfe, fore-ſeeing and fore-ſhewing what manner of death Chriſt our Lord ſhould dye.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle aſſureth vs that in this forme of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution wee may beehold how Chriſt did vndertake all the
<pb facs="tcp:4351:151"/> malediction due vnto all the elect on himſelfe: for he ſaith. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>that hee was made a curſe for vs,</hi> and againe, in the like phraſe. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He was made ſinne for vs.</hi> By which manner of ſpeaking wee may not feare that any manner of reproch is offred the ſonne of God: for both ſinne and the curſe following, are his but by imputation. Though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of himſelfe hee was no ſinner, yet as hee was our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hee became ſinne for vs, and conſequently the curſe of the Law for vs, in that the curſe euerie way due vnto vs, by imputation and application were made his.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Inſtructions and Conſolations which follow this Faith.</head>
               <p>Firſt, we learne here with bitterneſſe to bewaile our ſins, for Chriſt ſuffred here the whole wrath of God not for any offence that euer hee committed, but all for vs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iuſt cauſe haue we to mourne for our owne ſinnes, which brought our Sauiour to this low and baſe eſtate. If a man ſhould bee ſo farre in debt that hee could not bee freed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the ſuretie ſhould bee caſt into priſon for his ſake, nay which is more be cruellie put to death for his debt, it would make him at his wits end (if there were left but naturall and ciuill humanitie in him) and his very heart would bleed. And this is the caſe with vs by reaſon of our ſinnes, wee are gods debters, yea, bankrupts beefore him, yet haue wee gotten a good ſurety euen the Sonne of God himſelfe, who to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs to our former libertie, was crucified and dyed for the diſcharge of our debt. And therefore as the Prophet ſaith, wee <hi>ſhould looke vpon him whom wee haue peirced and lament for him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> Looke as the bloud followed the nailes that were ſtricken through the bleſſed hands and feete of Chriſt, ſo ſhould the meditation of Chriſts paſsion bee as nayles and ſpeares to draw bloud from our hands and hearts for our ſinnes.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:4351:151"/>
               <p>Secondly, if thou doubteſt where to ſee and find Chriſt crucified, becauſe the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> bids thee looke on him: be aduertiſed, that he is ſet before thy face as nailed and faſtned on a croſſe whereſoeuer his Goſpell is truly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thine hearing, for ſo the Apoſtle teacheth vs. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Oh fooliſh Galathians who hath bewitched you, that yee ſhould not obay the truth, to whom, before, Ieſus Chriſt was deſcribed in your ſight and among you crucified?</hi> wee muſt ſeeke Gods face in Chriſt, who is the liuely forme or moſt bright glory, wherein wee behold God himſelfe: and we muſt euer ſeeke Chriſts face in the Goſpell: if wee finde it not there wee periſh euerlaſtingly. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.4. wee need not goe to croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nay, we muſt not goe, but to the glaſſe hee hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe appointed for vs. And remember it, that till ſuch time as we come thus by faith and meditation of the Goſpell, we lye continually as poyſoned by Sathan that old Serpent and as ſtung to death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee learne to follow Chriſt in the purſute and crucifying of our ſinnes, for ſo wee bee thaught. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſts haue crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof.</hi> That is they endeuour to kill the power of ſinne in themſelues by repentance, prayer, faſting, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conference with the Saints and by auoyding all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of offence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee here learne in this preſident, that ſeeing the Sonne of God was not onely thus racked and crucified by men, but alſo bare the whole wrath of God in his ſoule, that therefore wee muſt beare to make ſo little account of ſinne as commonly wee doe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, whereas the perſon crucified was the very Sonne of God, it is manifeſt that the loue of God vnto vs in our redemption is endleſſe like the deepe ſea without bank or bottome: as it is teſtified. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.16. and if wee ſhall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to bee ſo our condemnation will bee the greater.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the curſe of God beeing here once and full borne
<pb facs="tcp:4351:152"/> of the ſonne of God, not for himſelfe but for his elect: it ſtandeth not with Gods iuſtice to lay any curſe on them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: wherefore when they bee afflicted, their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are but temporarie, and not curſes but croſſes, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticements which proceed not from anger, but from a moſt louing Father and ſo euer to bee accounted. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5.6.7.8.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 35. Now let me heare yet a little more of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his enemies againſt him, Iewes and Gentiles, and of his paſsions on the Croſſe? what herein we be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to obſerue.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, they ſtone him not, as many malefactors were executed, as <hi>Achan. Ioſhua.</hi> 7. and <hi>Naboth.</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.13. but for a greater reproch, they crucifie him, and this was the moſt ſhamefull death among the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they crucifie him naked after much beating, bleeding and fainting: and ſo make his greene wounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to lye open euen before the Sunne to his greater greefe and paine: the Sonne of God is crucified naked: to couer our ignominious nakedneſſe, hee bare all the puniſhments due to ſinne: nakedneſſe was one. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7.8. and couers our ſpirituall nakedneſſe, which is, when a man hath his ſinnes lying open before the eyes of God, whereby hee lyes open to all Gods iudgements. Againe, in that Chriſt ſuffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on this wiſe to bee ſtript naked of all that hee hath on his back, to redeeme vs, wee muſt remember that (if God call vs to any tryall hereafter) wee muſt bee content in like manner to part with all for his ſake that wee may poſſeſſe him and follow his example.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they peirced his hands and feete according to the prophecie of the Pſalmiſt.<note place="margin">Iraen. li. 2. c. 42. Auguſt. lib. ſo. hom 3. Author libri de paſsione inter opera Cypriani.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16. in thoſe parts which are moſt liuely and ſenſible, and ſo the waight of his body was borne vp by hands and feete faſtned to the Croſſe: but not in that groſſe manner that blinde Papiſts haue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: but the feet nailed a ſunder with two diſtinct nailes as godly Auncients haue deliuered.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:4351:152"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, they gaue him vineger and gall to drinck tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with mirth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.34. Some think to take away his ſenſes and memory by intoxicating (as it were) his braine. Thus they haſtned his death not hauing any reſpect at all of his ſoule, whether hee dyed in peace and fauour with God, yea or nay. Others thinke it was to haſten his death, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it was, euery ſinner here is to bee aduertiſed, that it was and is hee as well as the Iewes tempers, or hath tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch a cup of poiſon for Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, they crucified him betweene two theeues. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.38. for his greater ſhame,<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.6.</note> whereby they teſtifie that they eſteemed him no common ſinner, but the captaine of all theeues and malefactours. So think thou thy ſelfe with <hi>Paul</hi> that thou art <hi>the greateſt of all ſinners.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, they all mocked him, Iewes and Gentiles, wagging their heads and ſpeaking ſpitefull words againſt him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. ver. 39.45. <hi>Thou that deſtroyeſt the temple and buildeſt it vp in three daies ſaue thy ſelfe.</hi> And againe, <hi>He ſaued others let him ſaue himſefe.</hi> The Iewes payed deerely for this moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and for crying: <hi>his bloud bee vpon vs and our children:</hi> for their children abide vnder the heauie wrath of almighty God for it vnto this day.</p>
                  <p>Seauenthly, and laſtly, when the Lord Chriſt had made an end of all things, and had giuen full ſatisfaction to his fathers iuſtice, after all his wraſtling with Sathan and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and after many paſsions in ſoule and body: hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all this weariſome fight with this prayer immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before his death: <hi>Father into thy hands I commend my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Luke.</hi> 23.46. By his example hee teacheth vs to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſpirits to the father of ſpirits: who can preſerue any work ſo wel as the craftſ-maſter? &amp; ſhall not the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creator of ſoules doe this more carefully then man? In great dangers we commit our Iewels to our beſt friends: ſo do thou thy ſoule vnto Ieſus Chriſt, that thou maiſt ſay with Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I haue beleeued, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 36. The paſsion of Chriſt is a mirrour of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are the more excellent for that they bee ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs not in rules and doctrines, but in his owne holy prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, name ſome of them in order.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> names ſixe vertues or ſpeciall graces proper to Chriſt, and communicate by him in ſome meaſure to all his members. Chap. 11.2. The ſpirit firſt, of Wiſedome: ſecondly, of Iudgement: thirdly, of Councell: fourthly, of Fortitude: fiftly, of knowledge: and ſixtly, of the feare of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for Wiſedome and Iudgement they bee two ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all graces: differing as I take it in men on this manner. The former is the generall comprehenſion or knowledge of things: the latter is the experience of that knowledge in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions, experience in other things will cleere this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. Wee ſee in Phiſick and other Arts, many by much reading to haue obtained ſingular knowledge ſo that they thinke with themſelues, they could doe great matters, yet when they come to haue the vſe of their knowledge in ſome particular matters, they are oftentimes to ſeeke, and their knowledge for want of experience doth ſoone faile them. Now for the Sonne of God hee was full of wiſedome and ſpirituall vnderſtanding, and yet reſpecting his humanitie, it is teſtified of him. <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.52. <hi>that hee increaſed in wiſedome.</hi> His wiſdome did appeare in the whole work of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in fore-ſeeing and fore-ſhewing to his Apoſtles all things which ſhould happen and bee done to him by the Iewes:<note place="margin">Chriſts wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and iudgement in his paſsion.</note> aſſuring them that this was his fathers will manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophets, his ſingular iudgement is to bee ſeene in his preparation to that conflict with Sathan and ſinners by meditation and praier, in chooſing ſo fitlie the time and place for his apprehenſion: and in all his moſt apt and fit anſweres to all queſtions and demands made vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for Counſell: The Lord Chriſt was full of the ſpirit of Counſell: for he was able to withſtand and to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4351:153"/> all the counſell of hell and Sathan, of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> of <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> againſt him: hee was ready in all temptations to anſwere all doubts which the Prince of darkneſſe was able to obiect againſt him: he was not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor to ſeeke for councell in the whole worke, nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the worke of our redemption. The ſpirit of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell did appeare notably in him in all his arraignement and paſsion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the ſpirit of Fortitude was in him in a moſt rich meaſure: for hee wreſtled not in this action with fleſh and bloud, but incountered with ſpirituall powers and principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, euen with all the power of hell. This is the ſtrong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tribe of <hi>Iudah:</hi> and the ſeede of the woman which in his great ſtrength breakes the Serpents head. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. hee was ſo full of might that with one word ſpeaking hee caſt downe all that came to take him, euen to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee was full of the ſpirit of Knowledge to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all his enemies, and to diſcerne what was in them, for ſo it is teſtified of him. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Ieſus knowing all things that ſhould come vnto him. &amp;c.</hi> Hee knew all their purpoſes, deſires, perſons, places, and all their deſignements.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, the <hi>Spirit of the feare of the Lord,</hi> hee was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with it: as appeareth in all his ſeruice and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his heauenly father, for hee honoreth him in all his worke, and faithfully performeth all that ſeruice in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects for the which hee had ſent him, euer ſeeking his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.31. <hi>Now the Sonne of man is glorified, and God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, for humilitie,<note place="margin">The humilitie of Chriſt.</note> hee is the onely patterne that euer was on earth, for this cauſe the Apoſtle willeth vs to carrie within vs the <hi>ſame minde that was in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> that is, the ſame ſpirit of humilitie: for ſaith hee: <hi>He being in the forme of God and thinking it no robberie to bee equall with God, yet hee made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto men, and was found in ſhape as a man: hee humbled himſelfe and became obedient vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:4351:154"/> death, euen the death of the Croſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The meeknes of Chriſt.</note>Seauenthly, for the Spirit of Meekeneſſe: hee was full of mildeneſſe and meekeneſſe in the whole courſe of his life, as himſelfe truely teſtifieth of himſelfe. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28.29. <hi>Come vnto mee all yee that are wearie, and laden and I will eaſe you; take my yoke on you and learne of me, that I am meeke and lowly of heart, and ye ſhall finde reſt vnto your ſoules.</hi> This ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue did notablie appeare in his paſsion: for the prophecie of <hi>Eſay</hi> was accompliſhed in him: <hi>He was oppreſſed and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yet did hee not open his mouth.</hi> For ſo wee finde it teſtified, for when falſe witneſſes vrged him, and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> yet hee was ſilent, becauſe hee was willing to die, and ſaw there was no place to ſpeake either for the <note n="*" place="margin">When to ſpeake.</note>glory of God or the good of men.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, as Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> commends <hi>Iob</hi> for patience: ſo much more may the Sonne of God bee recommended as a mirrour of patience to all the world:<note place="margin">Chriſts patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> for hee was ſoft in his anſweres, and calme in all ſpeeches to all his moſt bloudy enemies, to <hi>Iudas</hi> betraying him with a kiſſe, hee ſaid. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.50. <hi>friend wherefore art thou come?</hi> and to the high prieſts officers which ſmote him. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.23. <hi>If I haue euill ſpoken, beare witneſſe of the euill, but if I haue well ſpoken why ſmiteſt thou me? Herod</hi> thought him a foole for his ſilence and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, whereby wee bee taught in all vniuſt railings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries not to giue rebuke for rebuke, but either to keepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or elſe to ſpeake ſo much as ſhall bee for our iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſts loue.</note>Ninthly, hee was full of loue, mercie and compaſsion, in the mideſt of his paſsions, euen to his enemies: he cured <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> eare, which <hi>Peter</hi> had cut off, with his ſword: And when they were practiſing againſt him all trecherie, euen then hee performeth the work of a Mediator, praying for them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.34.</note> ſaying: <hi>Father forgiue them for they wot not what they doe:</hi> for his friends hee is moſt mindefull of them &amp; louing vnto them euen in his greateſt paſsions: in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, he deſireth his Diſciples might be let goe freely.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4351:154"/> 
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.8. <hi>If ye ſeeke mee let theſe goe their way.</hi> As for <hi>Peter</hi> after hee had renounced him with bitter execrations, <hi>he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe, and looked gratiouſly on him,</hi> and quickned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.61. Hee ſhewed mercie on the theefe which did hang by him on the Croſſe: comforting him in theſe words. <hi>Verily I ſay vnto thee, to day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi> ver. 43. Laſtly, he recommends his mother to the cuſtodie of <hi>Iohn.

                  <p>Tenthly, finally, we finde in Chriſts paſsion a notable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident for perſeuerance: for hee wades through all the Sea of his temptations, hee neuer flincks back, nor turnes aſide to reſt him, till hee comes to the very ende of all his weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome raſe, notwithſtanding all the torments and teares hee had within and without, yet hee reſted not till hee came to the mark hee ſet before him, then he cryed <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> all my worke is accompliſhed, and ſo hee departed from euill men and euill Angels vnto God, and vnto the ſpirits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men and holy Angels.</p>
                  <p>Thus then wee ſee in his paſsion the practiſe of many moſt excellent vertues: whereby he did not onely gaine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to ſaue vs, but alſo gaue ſpeciall inſtructions to guide and direct vs in the whole courſe of our life.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4351:155"/> Lambe of God. The accompliſhment and truth of the types and prophecies are recorded faithfully. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.29. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. Chapter. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. and 27. Chapters. <hi>Marke.</hi> 15. <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.26.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee dyed to ſatisfie the iuſtice of God for the elect, that hee might free them from death and from the feare of death: as it is written. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. foraſmuch as the children were partakers of fleſh and bloud, hee alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part with them, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had power ouer death, that is the Diuell, <hi>and that he might deliuer all them, which for feare of death were all their life time ſubiect to bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondlie, he dyed to fulfill all the promiſes of God from the beginning. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Death of Chriſt volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie</note>Thirdly, I ſay his death was voluntarie and an accurſed death: firſt voluntary for ſo he ſpeaketh. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>No man taketh my life from mee, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe.</hi> Secondly, it was an accurſed death: for ſo it is written. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for vs,</hi> and how, he ſheweth it in the words following, <hi>Curſed is euerie one that hangeth on a tree,</hi> as if hee ſhould auouch in effect, that Chriſts death was accurſed: that is, that it contained in it the firſt and ſecond death, that is, the ſeparation of body and ſoule, and a ſeparation of both for a time from God: for that for a time hee did apprehend and vndergoe the wrath of God due to man for ſin, yet was hee neuer out of Gods fauour, for in the mideſt of his loud cries, hee cals God his God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46. hee was neuer ſo oppreſſed of death as the damned are.<note place="margin">Chriſt died the firſt death one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffring the pangs of the ſecond.</note> Hee ſuffred the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death without any corruption of body, ſo hee ſuffred the extreame pangs of the ſecond death, but not as forſaken of God, more then in his owne apprehenſion and feeling.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the comforts and vſe wee haue of this faith: or the bleſsings wee reape by the death of Chriſt are many, and very precious, neuer to bee forgotten of true hearted beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this voluntarie and true obedience of Chriſt vnto
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4351:155"/> death, euen this accurſed death is our righteouſneſſe before God, as it is written. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>As by the diſobedience of one man many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one righteous many are made righteous.</hi> In this righteouſneſſe of Chriſts death lyeth the cheefe matter of all our felicitie and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould reioyce in any thing but in the Croſſe of Chriſt.</hi> There is no one thing more recommended in ſo many and ſo euident prophecies then this: So by the death of Chriſt I am freed from the ſecond death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this faith in Chriſt crucified and dead for vs: I behold to mine exceeding comfort a diuine proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene the infinite debt of Gods elect, and the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation done by the death of Chriſt vnto Gods iuſtice for the ſame as infinite as the debt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſee the inſpeakable loue of God to his Elect continually preached vnto me and manifeſted as before mine eyes. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I ſee that Gods diuine iuſtice is ſatisfied by Chriſts death, in the ſame nature which offended him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. to mine exceeding great conſolacion.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, my trembling conſcience by this faith is quieted and pacified, for I feele hereby that the pollution of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is done away, becauſe my heart is ſprinckled with the bloud of Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and the ſcorching heate of it is delayed by this water of life, which ſtreames vnto mine heart from the ſide and heart of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Zac.</hi> 12.10.11. and 13. Chap. ver. 1.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, the firſt death which is a part of Gods curſe for ſin, by the death of Chriſt is turned into a bleſsing, and made vnto mee a gate to life: So that now I may truly ſay, <hi>that the day of death is better vnto me then the day wherein I was borne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seauenthly, the death of Chriſt doth ratifie his laſt will and teſtament vnto me. Thus it pleaſed the father to make authenticall and to ſeale vnto me the couenant of grace. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.16.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4351:156"/>
                  <p>Eightly, by his death hee hath not onely taken away the condemnation of ſinne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. for vs, but alſo hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the power and infection of it in vs. The act of Chriſts death is paſt, but the vertue and power thereof endureth for euer. When we haue grace to denie our ſelues, and to put our truſt in Chriſt, and by faith hold him faſt in our hearts: then as Chriſt himſelfe by the power of his God-head ouercame death, hell and damnation in himſelfe, ſo ſhall wee by the ſame power of his God-head and grace dwelling in vs. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. crucifie the fleſh with the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and luſts thereof. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25.26.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, the death of Chriſt ought to bee to all impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners, the greateſt motiue to moue them and turne them vnto Chriſt, and to humble them, becauſe they haue peirced him by their ſinnes: This I ſay ought to cauſe them to mourne for him (as the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> ſpeaketh. Chap. 12.10.) whom euen they themſelues, and not the Iewes haue wounded. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53. wherefore if this moue them not, their caſe is dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, be ready if thou beeſt a beleeuer to lay downe thy life for Chriſt, if neede ſo require, as hee hath done for thee: and to dye rather then to doe any thing, which thou knoweſt manifeſtly to bee contrary to his will: of this mind were all the Martyrs and faithfull people of God in all ages.</p>
                  <p>Eleauenthly, furthermore ſpeciall inſtructions, if it bee doubted, what the alter was whereon Chriſt offred his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice becauſe the Prieſts auouch it to bee the Croſſe: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue rather that Chriſt himſelfe was the Prieſt, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the Alter: the Sacrifice as hee is man: the Prieſt, as hee is both God and man: the Alter, as hee is God, for the propertie of an Alter is to ſanctifie the Sacrifice, as Chirſt ſaith. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.9. Now Chriſt as hee was God ſanctifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as hee was man. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>for their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelfe:</hi> and this hee did, firſt, by ſetting apart his manhood to bee a Sacrifice vnto his Father for our ſinnes: Secondly, by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:4351:156"/> giuing vnto this Sacrifice merit and efficacie to bee a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſacrifice, wherefore the wodde croſſe was not his Altar, as Papiſts haue imagined.</p>
                  <p>Twelftly, the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſaith, that the ſecond tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built by <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was nothing in beautie vnto the firſt which was built by <hi>Salomon:</hi> for it wanted fiue things which the firſt Temple had: firſt, the appearing and preſence of God at the mercie ſeate betweene the two Cherubins: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the vrim and thummim on the breſtplate of the high Prieſt: Thirdly, the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie Prophets: Fourthly, the Arke of the couenant, which was loſt in the captiuitie: Fiftly, fire from heauen to burne their Sacrifices. And yet notwithſtanding all this loſſe, the ſame Prophet in the ſame Chapter, the tenth verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing aſſureth that <hi>the glorie of the laſt houſe ſhall bee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the firſt:</hi> becauſe the Sacrifice of Chriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhould giue glory and dignitie to it: and for that his preſence, preaching and teaching in it, gaue it more glory, then the former fiue ſpeciall graces and gifts of God did or could giue vnto the firſt temple.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Two manner of waies Firſt, by arguments which hee gaue then and there of his glorious maieſtie and diuine excellencie: Secondly, by ſignes of victorie. The ſignes of a diuine maieſtie in him then and there, ſo crucified, are theſe following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the title ſet ouer his croſſe: <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth king of the Iewes: Pilate</hi> intending hereby to aggrauate his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the ouer-ruling hand of God ruling his hart and hand, cauſed him to write that which Patriaches and Prophets in all former ages had taught and prophecied of him. This was done by the prouident hand of God, for the aduancement and glorie of Chriſt. So did <hi>Caiphas,</hi> he prophecied of him, that it was neceſſarie that one ſhould die for the people.
<pb facs="tcp:4351:157"/> God turnes <hi>Balaams</hi> curſings into bleſsings.<note place="margin">When a man is moſt diſgraced in the world, then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God and his children moſt honour him.</note> And the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription which <hi>Pilate</hi> ſet on the Croſſe was in three languages of the beſt note, no doubt by Gods ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, to publiſh the death of the Sonne of God to all nations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the conuerſion of the theefe crucified with him, is a very worthy argument of his diuine excellencie: for by it he giues a notable experience vnto the world of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his death and vertue of his paſsion. He gaue the theefe, as great a ſinner (as it is like) as the other, a penitent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing heart, ſo that albeit his hands and feete were nayled to the croſſe, yet his hart and tongue were at libertie to ſpeak good words,<note place="margin">Luke. 23.40.</note> both to ask the Lord Chriſt mercie, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his fellow for his ſinne. The grace of God in a man is like new wine in a veſſell, which muſt haue vent, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaketh.<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.38.</note> If the life of God be in vs, it will be ſeene in ſome motions or actions or both, for Chriſts ſpirit in him cauſed him: Firſt, to reproue and to endeuour to reduce his fellow to grace. Secondly, to condemne, humble and caſt downe himſelfe. Thirdly, to excuſe Chriſt, euen then when all accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, <hi>Peter</hi> denyed him, and all forſooke him. Fourthly, to beg mercie and grace at Chriſts hands, infallible notes of grace and ſound repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Eclipſe of the Sunne.</note>Thirdly, the eclipſing and darkning of the Sunne from the ſixt houre to the ninth, was a miraculous ſigne of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine excellencie and maieſtie, for this eclipſe was not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie eclipſe (which euer hapneth in the new Moone by the interpoſition of the body of the Moone beetweene our ſight and the Sunne) for it was at the time of the Paſſeouer,<note place="margin">Luke. 23.44.</note> which alwaies was kept at the full Moone. Thus one of the beſt and worthieſt creatures in the world did preach Chriſt, when men condemned Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 27.11.</note>Fourthly, the rending of the vaile of the Temple, was one ſpeciall argument ſeruing to the ſame purpoſe, hereby was ſignified: firſt, that heauen, which was ſhut againſt vs for ſinne, is now ſet open: Secondly, that by Chriſt the mediator
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4351:157"/> wee haue free acceſſe to God by prayer in the name of Chriſt, without any ſtop: Thirdly, that the Iudaical and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſeruice was then at an end: Fourthly, that when we forſake god &amp; his word, God wil take from vs the beſt ſignes of his preſence and fauour, as the Temple was to the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, his maieſtie was ſet forth by an earth-quake:<note place="margin">An earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. Mat. 27.51.</note> for the very earth trembled, and deſired (as it were) to ſpeake and preach his power, when men denyed him, and crucified him.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, the perſons were honorable and reuerend, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Aramathea,<note place="margin">Io. 3.2. &amp; 19.39.</note> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that diſputed with him of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and came vnto him by night.

                  <pb facs="tcp:4351:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Now I can not beleeue that hell in this Article ſignifieth the graue: for that were but to darcken and obſcure that which was cleerely ſet downe before, which is not vſuall with Gods ſpirit, ſpecially in ſo ſhort an abſtract.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I can not vnderſtand this place of the hell of the damned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 1.3.</note>Firſt, for that the Euangeliſts, ſpecially <hi>Luke</hi> (promiſing ſo exactly to write of all points) ſpake nothing of locall deſcention to the place of the damned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If he deſcended into hell it muſt be in his god-head or man-hood: the God-head can neither aſcend nor deſcend, for it fils at all times all places: If in his man-hood hee deſcended, it was either in ſoule or body: the ſoule was the ſame day in Paradiſe. <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.43. the body three daies and three nights in the graue: and I can not ſee how in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe parts hee deſcended into hell.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there is an analogie betweene the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> the ſame day he ſinned was caſt out of Paradiſe, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> the ſame day he made ſatisfaction for ſinne went immediately into paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, many confeſsions of faith in former ages mention no ſuch locall deſcention of Chriſt, yea a great number haue clean omitted it, as is aforeſhewed. I know there is great ſtrife concerning this poynt: but wee may not ſtriue for that wee bee brethren, but aske that wiſedome of God, which hath theſe holy properties:<note place="margin">Iames. 3.15.17.</note> 
                     <hi>it is pure, next peaceable, ſober, tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ful of mercie and good fruits, without iudgeing or diſſembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Papiſts endeuor to defend the locall deſcenſion with traditions, and authoritie of the Church: ſome Proteſtants which hold this, defend it, or deſire to doe it by Scripture: And albeit both agree touching his deſcent, yet they diſagree touching the end of his deſcenſion.</p>
                  <p>The Popiſh tradicion or vnwritten veritie is that there bee foure chambers in hell: The firſt is purgatorie: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the <hi>Limbo</hi> of the fathers beefore Chriſt: the third is the <hi>Limbo</hi> of infants not baptiſed: the fourth, is the loweſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4351:159" rendition="simple:additions"/> place or hell of the damned.</p>
                  <p>Now they affirme forſooth that Chriſt went downe to the <hi>Limbo,</hi> or lake where the Fathers were before his comming, kept as it were in a barren, drie, cold wilderneſſe as in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for they ſpake of this place, as of the porch or entrance into hell, and they ſay they haue Scripture for it.<note place="margin">Pſa. 107.16.18. Zach. 9 11. Eſ. 38.10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwere: firſt, this popiſh inuention is farre from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for wee neuer read of any ſuch place, or words tending to ſuch a purpoſe: Secondly, the Scripture neuer ſpeakes but of two places one for the elect and an other for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate men and Angels: thirdly, as for <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome it can not ſignifie either Purgatorie or any <hi>Limbo:</hi> Firſt, for that there was ioy in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, but here (as they ſay) is none: Secondly, for the diſtance of place was ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene it and the hell of the damned. <hi>Luke.</hi> 16. that it can not bee any <hi>Limbo,</hi> which as (they ſay) is ſo neere hell, as if there were but an hedge betweene them. Thirdly, wee ſay the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had the ſame Chriſt with vs. <hi>He.</hi> 13. the ſame faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. the ſame Sacraments in ſubſtance. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.2.3. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they had the ſame glory: and therefore neuer came to <hi>Limbo.</hi> Laſtly, it is cleerly auouched that the ſoules departed before Chriſt went to God that gaue them. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants which defend a locall deſcention, are of this iudgement for that they finde ſome Scriptures which ſeeme to ſerue well for this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Scripture which is moſt cited to this ende is. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Chriſt was quickned in ſpirit, by the which ſpirit hee went, and preached to the Spirits which are in priſon.</hi> Firſt, for this Scripture, it is like that hee alludes here to that which is written. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. ver. 3. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtriue with man.</hi> For it was the ſpirit of Chriſt which then preached by <hi>Noah,</hi> and the ancient Patriarches before him, againſt whom thoſe Gigantine ſpirits of <hi>Cains</hi> progenie did ſo reſiſt to their owne perdition. I ſay therefore, that the ſpirit of Chriſt which is here ſaid to preach, was not his ſoule, but his God-head, or the holy Ghoſt who proceedes from the Father and the Son.
<pb facs="tcp:4351:160"/> And againe, this is ſaid here, that this ſpirit did quicken him, or raſed him from the dead.</p>
                  <p>Now it is cleere that the holy Ghoſt quickned Chriſts dead body, vniting his ſoule and body againe together in his reſurrection and that by his owne almightie power. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3.4. and 8.11. Further it is here ſaid that he went <hi>to preach to the ſpirits that are in priſon,</hi> whereby they vnderſtand the <hi>damned.</hi> I anſwere take the words following, <hi>which were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient in the dayes of Noah.</hi> And now ſee what can they make of it? But that he muſt goe preach to a few damned Ghoſts and not to all in hell. To be ſhort, then the meaning of this place is this, that Chriſt in his eternall God-head did preach by <hi>Noah,</hi> as by other Patriarches vnto the ſoules that are now in priſon, which in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> were men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on the earth, at which time Chriſt did preach vnto them and neuer ſince. The ſame Apoſtle hath the like ſpeech. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> chap. 4. ver. 6. <hi>Vnto this purpoſe was the Goſpell preached vnto the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Scripture moſt vrged for this purpoſe is the place before cited. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> I anſwere, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> drift here is plaine, hee alleadgeth this Scripture to proue the reſurrection: as ver. 33. <hi>He ſeeing this before ſpake of the reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> what ſpake he? name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe words <hi>his ſoule was not left in hell.</hi> Now I truſt no man will ſay there is any reſurrection of the ſoule. The word <hi>Soule</hi> ſignifies often the whole perſon,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1. 1. Cor. 15.41. Reue. 20.14. 1. Co 1.15.55.</note> as <hi>Leu. The Soule that ſinneth ſhall dye.</hi> The word here tranſlated <hi>Hell</hi> ſignifies alſo as often the graue. And <hi>Peters</hi> oppoſition betweene <hi>Dauids</hi> graue and Chriſts hell is to be obſerued: for <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in his graue, but Chriſt did not, albeit hee were loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp in the graue as ſure as he for three dayes.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I muſt then paſſe ouer their iudgement alſo which take the word <hi>Hell,</hi> for the extreeme helliſh ſorrowes which Chriſt ſuffred on the Croſſe and in the Garden. And I will doe ſo willingly, for I truſt none of them loue to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious. Yet to giue reaſon of my diſlike of this acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I anſwere ſuch as bee brethren on this wiſe breefly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that Chriſt in his death and before did ſuffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme ſorrowes: and therefore the ſame ſet downe cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, may not here bee obſcurely repeted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that his paſsions before death were inuiſible, and inexplicable, not terrors, but helliſh torments: his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 23.24.</note> ſweat, his <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 27.47.</note> ſtrong crying, his <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> amazedneſſe, are cleare and moſt euident demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p>I doe therefore iudge theſe words, hee deſcended into hell, are beſt vnderſtood in the fourth acception of the word, for by the graue, or this word <hi>Hell,</hi> that baſe condition of the body lying in the graue, as it were in the dungeon and bondage of death, is often vnderſtood, and in this ſtate was Chriſt in the graue, all which time the Diuell and the Iewes and death, ſeemed to triumph ouer him, for thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes as of him. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 53.8. <hi>Hee was taken out from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> wherefore for a time hee lay as ſwadled in the bands of death: ſo of his type <hi>Ionas</hi> cha. 2. ver. 2. <hi>In mine affliction haue I called vpon the Lord, and he hath heard me, from the belly of Hell haue I called vpon thee, and thou haſt heard my voyce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And albeit Chriſt was exceedingly humbled on the croſſe, and accounted as one forlorne and forſaken of God: yet the rage and madneſſe of his enemies had not beene ſatisfied, vnleſſe hee had wholy lyen ſhut vp, and bound vp in the graue. For they were not quieted, nor ſecure touching their victorie ouer him,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.62.63.</note> till the ſepulcher was ſealed and kept with a certaine number of armed men.</p>
                  <p>And thus the enemies of grace labored for the cutting off of the Meſsias. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. and to triumph ouer him. But he was ſoone looſened of the ſorrowes of death and theſe bands of hell, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, it was impoſsible for this <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4351:161"/> to bee long ſo bound vp of his enemies.<note place="margin">Act. 2.24.</note> And like as they ſeemed to triumph ouer the Lord and head vntill the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: ſo the ſame enemies, Sathan, death, and the graue ſeeme to haue ſwallowed vp all the bleſſed members of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and to triumph ouer them in like manner, but their deliuerance alſo commeth: for which cauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teaching vs to caſt the eye of our faith on the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, breakes forth into this holy exclamation. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O death where is thy ſting, O graue where is thy victory.</hi> And thus the Sonne of God humbled himſelfe, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as nothing. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.</p>

               <p>Firſt, I am comforted by this loweſt degree of Chriſts humiliation on this manner. I ſee nothing was left vndone for the full acompliſhment of the whole worke of my redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Soune of God was left, as it were, for a ſeaſon faſt bound in the hands and in the bands of death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I muſt bee comforted in extreeme dangers, and afflictions of body and minde when I ſeeme to bee forſaken of God: for I ſee the Son of God preſſed but not oppreſſed, caſt downe into the danger of death, yet not forſaken of god.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the feares of death and of the graue terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, I muſt record my former experience of Gods loue in mine illumination, conuerſion, and ſanctification. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. and ſo ouercome the feares of death, but ſpecially to this end muſt I record this humiliation of the Sonne of God.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I know and profeſſe with mouth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in mine heart that Ieſus Chriſt the onely beegotten Sonne of God, being truely dead and buried, roſe againe in the ſame very body wherein hee dyed, from death to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And of this I haue moſt pregnant proofe, and cleere euidence to reſt my faith vpon, from the Scriptures, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of holy men and Angels.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the teſtimonie of Scriptures. Thus the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to proue the Reſurrection. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3.4. <hi>I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto you, that which I receiued, how that Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes, according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he aroſe the third day according to the Scriptures. Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Hee dyed for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtification.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14. <hi>If Chriſt bee not riſen, then is our preaching in vaine, and our faith is alſo in vaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The prophecies are theſe. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53.8. <hi>He was taken out from the priſon, and from iudgement. Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>For thou wilt not leaue my ſoule in the graue, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The accompliſhment of theſe prophecies are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the new Teſtament, namely, in theſe places. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.31. <hi>Dauid knowing before, ſpake of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, that his ſoule ſhould not be left in the graue, neither his fleſh ſhould ſee corruption.</hi> Againe, of the ſame prophecie, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Reſurrection of Chriſt alleadgeth it. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.35. He ſaith alſo in another place, <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> Howbeit, <hi>Dauid after he had ſerued his time, by the counſell of God, he ſlept, and was layd with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſaw corruption: but hee whom God raiſed vp ſaw no corruption.</hi> The ſigne or type of this buriall and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>Ionas:</hi> The thing ſignified and the accompliſhment of that prophecie is expreſly recorded. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39.40.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4351:162"/>
               <p>Secondly, the teſtimony of men accepted and approued of God in the Scriptures: firſt, the holy women which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed with him in his life, ſaw the ſepulcher, and teſtified his reſurrection. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.1. and their teſtimonie is allowed of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw him, and teſtified it. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and his teſtimony is accepted for a good euidence. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the twelue Diſciples or witneſſes which he had choſen, they ſaw him and teſtified. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.19.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle aſſureth vs that hee <hi>was ſeene of more then fiue hundred holy men at once:</hi> and their teſtimony is good. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, hee addeth, that hee ſaw Chriſt himſelfe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8. and his teſtimony is good.</p>
               <p>Or thus his fiue appearances: the firſt day, firſt, to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalene, Mar.</hi> 16.5.9. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.11. The ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance againe to <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and the other <hi>Mary. Mat.</hi> 28.9.

The fift appearance was to al the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.19. The ſixt appearance in the fortie dayes following: firſt, eight dayes after his Reſurrection to the Diſciples in a houſe together. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.16. Secondly, to ſixe or ſeauen as they went to fiſhing. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 21.1. Thirdly, to <hi>Iames</hi> alone. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.7. Fourthly, to all the Diſciples in the mountaine where hee <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.12.13. gaue them the Apoſtolicall commiſsion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16. Fiftly, the fift and laſt was in the mount of Oliues when hee aſcended <hi>Act.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the teſtimony of Angels. The Angels alſo as they did preach and teſtifie vnto men, being ſent from God, his conception, his birth: ſo they ſerued, attended, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred vnto him in his life, in his paſsion, in his graue, in his Reſurrection and aſcention: as they alſo teſtifie of all theſe Articles of the faith. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.5.6.7. <hi>The Angell of the Lord ſaid to the women, feare ye not: for I know that ye ſeeke
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4351:162"/> Ieſus which was crucified: he is not here: for he is riſen, as hee ſaid: come ſee the place where the Lord was laid: and goe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and tell his Diſciples, that he is riſen from the dead: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he goeth before you into Galilie: there yee ſhall ſee him, lo, I haue told you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the fourth teſtimony is the teſtimony of euery beleeuing heart. Euery beleeuer feeles in ſome meaſure, and deſires more and more with the Apoſtle. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>To feele and know the vertue of his Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In things naturall a man muſt firſt haue experience in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and feeling, and then beleeue: but it is contrary in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a man muſt firſt beleeue, and then comes experience afterward. The true beleeuer can ſpeake after his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thus: like as, though I were blinde and could not ſee with mine eyes the body of the Sunne in the heauens, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I feele the heat and comfort of the Sunne, therefore I beleeue the Sunne ſhines vpon the earth: euen ſo I finding the worke of the Sonne of God in mine heart, and in my firſt reſurrection, muſt verily beeleeue his bleſſed reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 43. Tell me next what was the manner of his reſurrection: and laſtly, what vſe we haue of this Article, and of this faith?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, the Lord Ieſus being truely dead and buried, roſe againe by his owne almighty power: as is often teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe: I haue power to lay it downe and haue power to take it againe.</hi> And ſo his Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> aſſure vs hee quickned himſelfe by his owne ſpirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 18.19. Whereby hee doth approue himſelfe comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably vnto vs to bee the very Sonne of God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> noteth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. ſaying, <hi>hee was declared mightely to bee the Sonne of God touching the ſpirit of ſanctification, by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as touching the forme he roſe in, or how his body was qualified. I anſwere that after his reſurrection his
<pb facs="tcp:4351:163"/> body was glorified richly, yea moſt gloriouſly qualified with ſupernaturall graces: his body was incorruptible, and it was made a ſhining body, a reſemblance whereof ſome of his Diſciples ſaw in the mount: and it was indued with agility to moue as well vpward as downeward, as may appeare by the aſcention of his body to heauen, which was not cauſed by conſtraint, or by any violent motiue, but by a propertie agreeing to all bodies glorified.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the exaltation of Chriſts manhood wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member two caueats: firſt, that hee did neuer lay aſide the eſſentiall properties of a true body, as length, bredth, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, viſibilitie, locallitie, or to be in one place at once, and no more, but keepeth all theſe ſtill, becauſe they ſerue for the being of his body. Secondly, wee muſt remember, that the gifts of glory in Chriſts body are not infinite, but finite: for his humane nature being but a creature, and therefore fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, could not receiue infinite graces, &amp;c. Chriſts body is not omnipotent and infinite: for this is to affirme he had no humane body, and to make the creature the creator. That it might appeare vnto the Diſciples hee had a glorious body and was changed: hee was not alwayes in their preſence, but came often ſodenly into their preſence, and once the doores being ſhut, the doores giuing place, and being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they knew not how: he that thickned the water to walk on, can cauſe doores and rockes to giue way vnto his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming without any peircing or paſsing through them, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts haue imagined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt had a reall and true body after the reſurrection.</note> Finally, that hee had a true body, a reall body, the very ſame wherein hee ſuffred, and not a fayned body (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques haue auouched) is teſtified by many arguments vnto vs: hee ſhewed ſome ſcars, wounds, and blemiſhes of his paſsion, in his body now glorified, as then remaining for the confirmation of men: and to this end he conuerſed with men: he did eate and drinke often in the preſence of his Apoſtles after his reſurrection.</p>

               <head>The vſe of this Article concerning Chriſts reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and of this Faith: is this.</head>
               <p>Firſt, the reſurrection of Chriſt is a publike teſtimony, that hee hath perfect righteouſneſſe for all ſuch as truſt in him:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.12.</note> for if there had remained but one of our ſinnes either vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly puniſhed in him, or not fully ſatisfied by him, hee could not aſſuredly then haue riſen from the death, for where but one ſinne is, there muſt bee death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. as God hath decreede. Like as then the father by deliuering Chriſt to death hath indeed condemned our ſinnes in Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. ſo by raſing him from death, hee hath abſolued Chriſt from our ſinnes, and vs in Chriſt. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. As our ſinnes are condemned and puniſhed in the death of Chriſt: ſo our abſolution and diſcharge is in his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Chriſt was giuen to death for our ſinnes and riſen againe for our iuſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the beleeuer is truely ſaid <hi>to be dead to ſinne:</hi> or to be dead with Chriſt: becauſe the vertue of Chriſts death works effectually in his heart the death of ſinne: and next <hi>to be buried with Chriſt into his death:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.2.3.4.</note> beecauſe of the vertue which proceedes from Chriſts buriall to cauſe him ſo to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinne, that it neuer can riſe vp any more to bee ſo ſtirring in him, as it was before he came to Chriſt. And laſtly,<note place="margin">The beleeuer truly ſaid to be dead with Chriſt, buried, and riſen with him.</note> the beleeuer is as truly ſaid <hi>to be riſen with Chriſt. Col.</hi> 3.1. bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſpeciall vertue and grace proceedes alſo from Chriſts reſurrection to the beleeuing heart to quicken it vnto new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life. And this is that grace, which the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires more and more to feele and find to abound in himſelfe, when hee deſires to know Chriſt better, <hi>and the vertue of his reſurrection. Phil.</hi> 3.10. Wherefore we muſt embrace Chriſt riſen in the armes of our precious faith, and ſo apply him vnto our hearts, that wee may ſenſibly feele vertue to come from him, not onely to crucifie our old affections, but alſo to ſtir vp dayly, new, holy, and heauenly affections in our
<pb facs="tcp:4351:164"/> harts. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>We are regenerate to a liuely hope by the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> As it was in the cure of the woman which had the bloudy iſſue, ſo it is in the curing and quickning of ſinners, which are full of bloudie iſſues, all which muſt bee ſtanched and cured by a certaine vertue deriued from Chriſt into them. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.29.30. This is the prayer. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the third fruit which is ioyned with the ſecond is the aſſurance of our perſeuerance in grace, and of our full victory againſt ſinne and death. For they that are ingrafted into Chriſt by faith draw from him ſuch a ſpirituall life and power,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.9.10.</note> as they ſhall neuer looſe, no not in the parting a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſoule and body. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.51. <hi>If any man keepe my word he ſhall neuer ſee death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the laſt benefite of his reſurrection, is the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our bodies. The truth is this, that good and bad ſhall riſe againe, yet there is a great difference in the riſing of the one and the other, for the Godly ſhall riſe by vertue of Chriſts reſurrection,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.14. Rom. 8.11. Phil. 3.21. 1. The. 4.14.</note> and that to eternall glory: but the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly riſe by the power of Chriſt not as hee is a redeemer, but as hee is a terrible Iudge, and to execute iuſtice on them. Now to the faithfull Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be the firſt fruits of them that ſleepe.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.16. becauſe as in the firſt fruites of corne being offred vnto God, the owner had an aſſurance of Gods bleſsing on the reſt: ſo here by Chriſts reſurrection the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers haue a pledge of their owne reſurrection.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 44. Thus farre the firſt degree of his exaltation: now let me heare of the ſecond, what doe you beleeue his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention into heauen?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That I doe: for this is not onely prophecied of in the old Teſtament; but alſo recorded and teſtified in the new Teſtament. And therefore I know, beleeue and profeſſe this to bee the moſt ſacred truth of God, that Ieſus Chriſt the very Sonne of the liuing God,<note place="margin">Act. 1.2.3.</note> fortie dayes after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, <hi>did aſcend vp into heauen.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:4351:164"/> in the old are theſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.17.18.19. <hi>The Charets of God are twentie thouſand, thouſand Angels, &amp;c. Thou art gone vp on high, thou haſt lead captiuitie captiue.</hi> The comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this, in the new Teſtament is. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. where the Apoſtle teſtifieth plainely, that the Pſalmiſt ſpake by the ſpirit of prophecie of Chriſts aſcention, and of his gracious bleſsings powred then, as in a ſolemne triumph, in angurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or coronation of a mightie prince, vpon his Church and people.</p>
                  <p>Againe that <hi>Dauid</hi> prophecied not of himſelfe, in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> auoucheth ſpeaking of the reſurrection of Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.34. <hi>Dauid is not aſcended into heauen,</hi> but hee ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaith to my Lord, ſit at my right hand, &amp;c.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe fore-ſheweth his aſcention into heauen. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.28. <hi>I leaue the world, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 14. And the holy Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts teſtifie with one accord that his words proued true, for that hee did in verity aſcend into heauen in his appointed time. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.19. <hi>So after hee had ſpoken vnto them, he was receiued into heauen. Luke.</hi> 24.51. <hi>And it came to paſſe as hee bleſſed them, he departed from them, and was carried into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Act.</hi> 1.9. <hi>while they beheld he was taken vp: for a cloud tooke him vp out of their ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doe therefore thus vnderſtand this miſtery in mind, and beleeue it in mine heart, and profeſſe it with my mouth: that the very ſame Chriſt, who according to his diuine nature was alwayes in the heauens. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.3. after he finiſhed the whole worke of our redemption on earth, and inſtructed his Diſciples fortie dayes as concerning the truth of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, ſo concerning the propagation of the Church, and publication, or preaching of the Goſpell, for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp of his miſticall body on earth: after all this (I ſay) accompliſhed, hee aſcended vp to heauen in the preſence of all his Diſciples, in that very body and ſoule, wherein hee liued, ſuffred and dyed on the Croſſe: and in that very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which was buried and roſe againe: in this body and ſoule, I ſay Ieſus Chriſt aſcended vp into heauen where hee muſt
<pb facs="tcp:4351:165"/> haue his reſidence, or bodily preſence <hi>vntill the time of the reſtoring of all things. Act.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>And by <hi>Heauen</hi> here I vnderſtand not the firmament, as. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. ver. nor the ayre.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.22.23. Mat. 18.10. 1 Cor. 13.2. 2. Cor. 12.2.3. Pſal. 103.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.26. but the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens where God, and his Angels, and the ſpirits of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous haue their reſt. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.2.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                  <p>Againe, whereas the Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>that he was taken vp,</hi> the meaning is, this was done princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by the mightie power of his godhead, and partly by the ſupernaturall propertie of a glorified body, which is to moue as well vpward as downeward without conſtraint or violence.</p>
                  <p>And thus Chriſt aſcended into heauen really and actually, and not in appearance onely. And hee went alſo locally by changing his place, and going from earth to heauen, ſo as hee is no more on earth bodily, as wee are now on earth: at is afore ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it may bee doubted, if hee bee ſo departed from vs, as touching his bodily preſence, how that may bee true, that hee ſaid hee would bee with vs vnto the end of the world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20?</p>
                  <p>The anſwere is: hee ſaid alſo that hee would leaue the world to goe to the father. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.28. Wherefore he muſt bee vnderſtood to ſpeake by a diſtinction. True it is he was before <hi>Abraham. Iohn.</hi> 8.58. and ſo is hee with his Church to the worlds end according to his diuine nature, in maieſtie, grace,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.8.</note> vertue, power, and effectuall working of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.11. and 14.16.17. and 16.13. but his bodily preſence is in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if any doubt further, whether the natures bee not thus ſeuered if where the one is, the other is not alwaies?</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, no: for the diuinitie which cannot bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, muſt of neceſsitie outreach, and yet comprehend the humanitie, and thereunto bee parſonally vnited. It is not alwaies true that of two things conioyned, where the one is there muſt bee the other alſo. For the Sunne and his beams
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4351:165"/> are both ioyned together, yet they are not both in all places together. For the body of the Sunne is ſeated and carried onely in his celeſtiall orbe in the heauens, but his beames are here beneath on the earth. In thoſe holy phraſes then we muſt remember that (as diuines ſpeake) the properties of both natures muſt bee diſtinguiſhed in Chriſt for in ſuch places, properties belonging to one nature, are aſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, becauſe of the hypoſtaticall vnion of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one perſon.</p>
                  <p>And thus far for the ſence of the words of this Article, where wee ſee breefly that Chriſts aſcention is an exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a receiuing vp of his humanitie to ſit in the higheſt heauens, till the glorious day of his appearance in iudgement. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 45. What vſe is there of this faith, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts follow it?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, when I doe thus beleeue the aſcention of Chriſt, I doe beleeue alſo all the effects thereof, and all the holy adiuncts appertaining thereunto: namely, theſe two principall, which the Apoſtle ſpecially mentioneth. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. and 12.1. <hi>That when he aſcended vp on high, he lead capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie captiue.</hi> By <hi>Captiuitie,</hi> vnderſtand a multitude of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, as the Pſalmiſt doth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. ver. 19. that captiues here meant, are the world, the fleſh, ſinne, Sathan, and death it ſelfe: and whatſoeuer engins and confederates theſe had againſt Chriſt in his humiliation, and his members all their dayes on earth. He ſo triumphed ouer them all on his croſſe. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. but ſpecially in his aſcention, that howſoeuer they may feare vs otherwhiles, and ſcare vs to waken vs from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, yet they ſhall neuer hurt vs, for Chriſt hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their ſting. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. and hath pinioned their hands behinde them as captiues, and hath ſet vs free, if wee will come vnto him, when hee call, vs by his Goſpell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee refuſe now his call, our ſtate is the more damnable. A man lies bound hand and foote in a darke dungeon, and the keeper ſets open the priſon doore, takes off his irons and
<pb facs="tcp:4351:166"/> bids him come forth: If hee refuſe, and and ſay, hee is well, may it not bee ſaid hee is mad, and who will pittie him in that caſe. This is the ſtate of all impenitents, and contemners of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is ſaid alſo that then hee gaue gifts to his Church, as Kings doe in their triumph: and his gifts were theſe, <hi>Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Euangeliſts,</hi> for the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and founding of his Church Catholike: <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> for the propagation of the ſame, and for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Elect to the worlds end. If theſe were Chriſts principall bleſsings which Chriſt gaue his Church in his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, and ſo richly and highly to bee accounted, as being deſtinate and ſent for ſo great a work as the building of the body of Chriſt, which is his Church on earth. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. then they doe not beleeue rightly and truely the aſcention of Chriſt, that ſo baſely and vilely eſteeme the ſacred mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his Sacraments, as Atheiſts and Papiſts and all carnall Goſpellers doe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, like as our iuſtification is aſcribed vnto his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and merit of the ſame: ſo our proceeding in grace and perſeuerance may truely be attributed to his aſcention to heauen and interceſsion there for vs. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. And like as he could neuer haue riſen in that body wherein he was accurſed for vs, vnleſſe he had been acquited, and iuſtified from all our ſinnes, ſo much leſſe could hee haue aſcended into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heauens, if hee had not beene pure from all our ſpots im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him, his aſcention is a cleere euidence of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.9.10. and conſequently, of our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in him and by him: for which theſe Articles are ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knit together, for the confirmation of our faith, touching our free iuſtification by Chriſt. <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.33.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? it is God that iuſtifieth: who ſhall condemne? it is Chriſt which is dead, yea, or rather which is riſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of God, and meketh requeſt for vs.</hi> Wherefore euer remember to reiect
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4351:166"/> the doctrine of Antichriſt, who teacheth that Chriſt by his death did mirit our iuſtification, but wee once iuſtified doe further merit our ſaluation. Whereas thou ſeeſt here not onely the beginning, but alſo the continuance, yea, the accompliſhment of the whole worke of our ſaluation, in our vocation, iuſtification, ſanctification, and glorification is wholy and onely to be aſcribed to the merit of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, wee receiue alſo by his aſcention, a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching our aſcention into heauen: for in beleeuing the one, wee beleeue the other: for the head and members muſt goe together. Wee bee not now coldly to looke for heauen, but by a liuely hope to poſſeſſe it: for that we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe it in our head already. For this cauſe it is written. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>That God hath made vs to ſit together in heauenly places in Chriſt.</hi> Hee hath there a pledge for vs, euen our fleſh, and we againe by his aſcention haue receiued from him an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly pledge, euen his ſpirit. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.7. <hi>I tell you the truth it is expedient for you, that I goe away:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1.13.14.</note> 
                     <hi>for if I goe not away the Comforter will not come vnto you.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. Hee hath ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs and giuen vs the earneſt of our ſpirits in our hearts.</p>

               <p>Secondly, if we beleeue we be poſſeſt of heauen in Chriſt: wee muſt ſtriue to enter into him, with all holy contention of ſpirit, vſing the meanes he hath appointed, that wee may come vnto him with all the good ſpeede wee can. If wee be aſſured of this purchaſe made for vs by his bloud, wee muſt paſſe through all dangers to come vnto him, and vnto it, and not contend to get in our ſelues, but alſo endeuour to bring with vs all wee can, ſpecially all ſuch as God by neere bands of loue hath knit vnto vs: as our wines &amp; children &amp;c. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding

                  <p>Thus then in few words I expreſſe my meaning, and faith concerning this Article: I ſay, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hauing accompliſhed all his worke on earth, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing committed the word of reconciliation, for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Elect vnto his holy miniſters: hee doth not now from hence forth after his aſcention, execute any of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in infirmitie, as before on earth, but in great excellencie and glory in the higheſt heauens. I doe therefore here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Chriſt God incarnate, beegan after his aſcention, and not before to ſit at the right hand of his father, and am perſwaded that Chriſt now ſitting in heauen,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. Rom. 8. Epheſ. 1.</note> both heares my prayers, and prayes alſo to his father for mee: and I am perſwaded that his vertue, grace and power is maruelous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall in the hearts and conſciences of all the faithfull, by meanes of his Goſpell,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 2.13.</note> albeit his bodily preſence bee as far diſtant from vs, as his ſeate in heauen is from our hearts on earth: <hi>for him hath God lifted vp with his right hand, to bee a Prince and a ſauiour, to giue repentance to Iſraell and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So thus I conclude: Chriſt God and man doth actually raigne in heauen, with the father in glory: and that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth and will doe all things by none other: and that none other is of power to execute this office of the head of the catholike and vniuerſall Church of Chriſt on earth, but
<pb facs="tcp:4351:168"/> onely our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now in that Chriſts placing at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, argues an inferioritie in Chriſt becauſe of one nature (as is aforeſaid) hence it appeares that they bee deceiued, who auouch that Chriſt glorified, hath ſuch a transfuſion of the proprieties of the God-head into his manhood, omniſcience, and omnipreſence, &amp;c. for this is to make the creature a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and ſo Ieſus Chriſt ſhould haue no true humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule in heauen, which were not to glorifie his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but to aboliſh it.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the word <hi>Almightie</hi> is repeted againe in this Article: it is to ſignifie the maieſtie of God the father, and ſo the excellencie of Chriſt, who is ſo aduanced, and glorified God and man, or the man Chriſt Ieſus, by ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a maieſtie.</p>
                  <p>Againe, here I profeſſe that by the ſeſsion of Chriſt at the right hand, &amp;c. two things muſt bee vnderſtood: firſt, that this bleſſed perſon of the Sonne hath the ſame equalitie of maieſtie and glory with the Father: Secondly, by this phraſe is alſo vnderſtood that the humane nature of Chriſt is exalted to a moſt high excellencie of glory, <hi>euen to execute iudgement as he is the Sonne of man. Ioh.</hi> 5.27.</p>
                  <p>And it may not be here ſaid, as in his reſurrection, that like as Chriſt roſe onely in reſpect of his humane nature, ſo alſo hee ſits at Gods right hand in reſpect of the ſame nature: for the ſeſsion at Gods right hand, is not a propertie of nature, but ſignifieth the ſtate of the perſon of Chriſt, reſting now in the execution of his offices, as being king, and prieſt, and mediator betweene God and his people. See, <hi>Bucanus pag.</hi> 260. <hi>Sedere igitur, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 47. Now proceed to the fruits which follow this faith.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The benefites which follow this exaltation and ſeſsion of Chriſt, at the right hand of God, are either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his prieſthood or of his kindome.</p>
                  <p>The beleeuer gaines theſe benefites by his prieſthood:</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:4351:168"/>
                  <p>Firſt, he is now, and may be truely perſwaded that as the couenant of grace and prieſthood of Chriſt haue<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 8.6.</note> none end, ſo his interceſsion for him and for all, euery beleeuer, ſhall neuer ceaſe to the end of the world: for all. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.5. 1. Iohn. 2.1. Iohn. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt is riſen againe and ſitteth at the right hand of God, and maketh requeſt for vs,</hi> and for euery one. <hi>I haue praid for thee Peter that thy faith faile not.</hi> The manner of this is this: hee appeares in heauen as a publike perſon in our ſtead: <hi>He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the ſight of God for vs. Heb.</hi> 9.24. and makes the ſame requeſts hee made on earth. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>The difference betweene Chriſts paſsion and interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this: the paſsion is as a ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice for vs, &amp;c. and as it were the tempering of a plaiſter, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion applies it to the very ſore.</p>
                  <p>So then the beleeuer is hereby ſweetly comforted in heart, being perſwaded that Chriſt Ieſus God and man (now ſitting in great maieſtie and glory in heauen) firſt, heares his prayers in heauen, and ſecondly, accepts and ſanctifies all his ſacrifice and ſeruice, which the beleeuer offers to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his hand. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. for all our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is imperfect, yet for his interceſsion ſake it is accepted as perfect.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond conſolation here ariſeth to the beleeuing heart: hee may now <hi>with boldneſſe goe to the throne of grace. Heb.</hi> 4.16. becauſe wee haue then an high Prieſt, <hi>an high Prieſt that ſitteth at the Throne of the Maieſtie in the heauens. Heb.</hi> 8.1. And for this cauſe the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle. Chap. 10.19.20. biddeth vs draw neere, <hi>with a true heart, and with an vndoubted perſwaſion of faith.</hi> And againe moſt ſweetly. <hi>Phil</hi> 4.6. <hi>Be nothing carefull, but in all things let your requeſts be ſhewed vnto God in praier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third conſolation is this: his interceſsion preſerues eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry repentant ſinner in the ſtate of Grace: that being once iuſtified and ſanctified, they may ſo continue vnto the end: whom he loueth once in his Chriſt, who ſtands before him, hee loues him for euer. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.29. If hee fall the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:4351:169"/> will raiſe him vp againe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a moſt ſweet conſolation is this: the interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt in heauen caſteth downe ſuch beames of grace into the beleeuers heart on earth, that it cauſeth another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion of the ſpirit in him: or cauſeth the ſpirit of prayer to be effectuall and working in him. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Hee giueth vs his ſpirit, which helpeth our infirmities, and maketh requeſt for vs, with ſighes and grows that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but hee which ſearcheth the hearts knoweth what is the meaning of the ſpirit, for hee maketh requeſt for the Saints accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God.</hi> The holy Ghoſt makes requeſt by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring euery repenting heart to pray with grones and ſighes, which the mouth cannot expreſſe: and this is a ſpeciall fruit of the interceſsion of Chriſt in heauen: ſo that a man may ſoone know by the ſpirit of prayer in his owne heart, how Chriſt prayeth for him in heauen. A man may ſoone finde it by his owne coldneſſe or feruency in prayer, or by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grones of his heart, when hee cannot ſo well expreſſe his greefe in words before God.</p>
                  <p>Here I renounce the opinion of Papiſts touching inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion as being hereticall, vncomfortable and condemned of God; Firſt, for that the Saints departed (who bee their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators with Angels) know not our particular wants and griefes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that hee that makes this interceſsion muſt bring ſomething of his owne of price and value vnto God to procure the graunt of his requeſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a prerogatiue belonging onely to Chriſt to make requeſt in his owne name and for his owne merits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.5. Iohn. 15.16. Iohn. 16.23. Eſ 63.16.</note>Fourthly, Scriptures neuer mention any other, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, wee muſt pray to him in whom wee beleeue. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. wee beleeue onely in one God, &amp;c. therefore we pray onely to one God.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore as touching his kingdome wee are well to conſider what kingdome hee hath: next what the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4351:169"/> of his kingdome is, and how comfortable to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that hee is Lord and King ouer all in reſpect of creation, as alſo of preſeruation and prouidence it is manifeſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.17. <hi>for by him were all things created in heauen and in earth, &amp;c. And in him all things conſiſt:</hi> hee is the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo much more by right of redemption. And his kingdome is eternall and ſpirituall, reſpecting the very conſcience, hauing that onely abſolute power to command and forbid, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and to abſolue the ſoule and conſcience: This is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Let all Iſraell know for a ſuretie, that God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt, this Ieſus (I ſay) whom yee haue crucified.</hi> And to teſtifie this his excellency: when Chriſt went vp to ſit on his throne for the gouernement of his Church: it is ſaid, hee gaue great gifts to his Church, farre excelling the gifts of earthly princes in their coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for (it is ſaid) hee gaue his Church <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Paſtors and teachers: Ephe.</hi> 4.11.12. Now the end and vſe of theſe guifts and benefites giuen by this great king is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: for there it is ſayd, that theſe were giuen for the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of his Church and the building of it. This collection is a ſeparation of the precious from the vile. <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.19. and a tranſlation of the Elect from the kingdome of darknes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of light. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.10.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.3. by the miniſtracy &amp; diſpenſation of the word of reconciliation. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. outwardly, and the working of the holy <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 11.13. Act. 16.9.6. Eſ. 11.2.3.4.5. Act. 2.32.33.</note> Ghoſt inwardly. And this is the firſt part of Chriſts office in his kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt leads his precious people as a great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doth his armie, through the wilderneſſe of this world, into his euerlaſting Canaan. And this hee doth alſo by the ſame meanes, whereby hee called them: his word and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments outwardly, the mightie operation of his ſpirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. And in this trauell hee doth exerciſe them (as in Canaan) with manifold afflictions and temptations in this life. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23. and yet defends them againſt the rage of all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
<pb facs="tcp:4351:170"/> firſt, giuing them in their life time ſtrength to ſuffer, and to fight againſt all his enemies moſt mightily. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Vnto you it is giuen for Chriſt, that not onely yee ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> Chap. 4.13. <hi>I am able to doe all things through him which ſtrengtheneth mee. Rom.</hi> 8.36.37. <hi>For thy ſake are wee killed all the day long, wee are counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter. Neuertheleſſe in all theſe things wee are more then Conquerous, through him that loued vs.</hi> And in death it ſelfe he neuer forſakes them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. 39. but then makes an euerlaſting ſeparation betweene them and all their enemies. <hi>Zac.</hi> 13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 48. Let me heare what you can ſay of the laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle concerning Chriſt, which is this: <hi>From thence hee ſhall come to iudge the quick and the dead?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I ſay this Article followes fitly after the former for confirmation of it: for the excellency of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall mightely and wonderfully appeare in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iuſtice, in the great day of the generall iudgement which ſhall bee in the laſt day of the world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to iudge, or to giue Iudgement is the proper acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and function of a Iudge, in condemning, or iuſtifying of any man. In condemning, by pronouncing him guilty of ſin, and therefore adiudging him to ſome puniſhment for his ſinne: in Iuſtifying, by pronouncing him iuſt, or acquiting him of ſinne, and ſo freeing him from the puniſhment of ſin, I ſay then the meaning of this Article is this: I beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt doth not onely now exerciſe his kingly office in heauen (as is afore ſhewed) but ſhal alſo triumphantly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the right hand of his father in a viſible forme, and corporall preſence to iudge all men that ſhall be found at his comming aliue or dead.</p>
                  <p>Now to proceed in order to ſpeake of this great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe poynts muſt bee conſidered: firſt, by what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments it may appeare that there ſhall be a generall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, what the forme and manner thereof ſhall bee. Thirdly, how this argument ſerues to comfort vs, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4351:170"/> to humble vs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that there ſhall bee an vniuerſall Iudgement may appeare thus, againſt cauellers that denie it.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Scriptures are moſt euident for this. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.1. <hi>The God of Gods hath ſpoken,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See. Mat 25.31. Luke. 8.17. Iohn. 12.48. Iud. 14.15. Luk. 21.28. 2. Tim. 4.1.7.8 Ioh. 5.22.27.</note> 
                     <hi>and called all the earth from the riſing of the Sunne to the ſetting of the ſame: our God ſhall come and ſhall not keepe ſilence. Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed vnto men that they ſhall once dye, and after that commeth the Iudgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt promiſeth his comming to Iudgement by himſelfe. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31. and by his Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Theſſo.</hi> 4.16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for that hee hath charged vs to wayte for his comming. <hi>Luke.</hi> 21.28.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23. Eph. 1.14.</note> and for the redemption of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. <hi>Luke.</hi> 21.28.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for that the iuſtice and mercy of God requires this, to puniſh the wicked and to crowne the Godly, which wee ſee is not in this life preſent: therefore there is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all day and time appointed with God for it.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, for that the Lord hath often forewarned the world of this. Firſt, by pronouncing the ſentence of death againſt ſinne euen before the fall. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Secondly, by repeating the ſame ſentence in his Law. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. Thirdly, by the euidence of conſcience, citing as it were men to appeare at a time appointed before the great Iudge. <hi>Ro.</hi> 2.15.16. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by his iudgements particular on Sodome and Gomorah, on Egipt, on Ieruſalem, and all the Iewes, and generally on the world in the deluge.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, by ſignes prognoſticating his comming: and theſe bee of two ſorts: firſt, before his comming: ſecondly, in his comming. The ſignes beefore his comming are either firſt, long before his comming: or ſecondly, not long before.</p>
                  <p>Signes of the end long beefore are theſe. The firſt is the preaching of the Goſpell to all the world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. And the Apoſtle affirmes this was done euen in his time, ſaying. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>The Goſpell hath beene preached to euery creature vnder heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4351:171"/>
                  <p>The ſecond ſigne before the end is the reuelation and manifeſtation of Antichriſt. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Before the day of Chriſt, the man of ſinne ſhall be diſcloſed,</hi> as hee is ſet out in the reuelation to all eyes in his colours. 14. 17. Chap. who ſhall cauſe the generall departing from the faith of Chriſt as it is foreſhewed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame Scripture.<note place="margin">2. The. 2.3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third ſigne, the Iudgements following vpon the world for the contempt of the Goſpell: warres, famine, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.6. <hi>See that ye be not troubled, for al theſe things muſt come to paſſe but the end is not yet,</hi> and perſecution. ver. 7.</p>
                  <p>The fourth ſigne the generall corruption of manners. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Toward the later dayes ſhall come perillous times, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men ſhall bee louers of themſelues, couetous, boaſters, &amp;c.</hi> much like for ſecuritie and ſinne to the dayes of <hi>Noah. Mat.</hi> 24.37.38. great deadnes of heart: They knew nothing, for all the preaching of <hi>Noah. Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>Luke.</hi> 17.26. Moſt men haue ſeene the firſt kinde of meſſengers and forerunners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, and be nothing touched with repentance by any of them: woe vnto them if they ſtay till the laſt ſignes come for then (ſaith Saint <hi>Luke</hi>) their hearts ſhall faile them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond kinde of ſignes pognoſticating his comming, more neere it, or immediately before it, are theſe. Firſt, in the heauen or firmament, <hi>the Sunne ſhall wax darke. Mark.</hi> 13.24. that is, haue as it were many Eclipſes, and the Moone ſhall faile of her accuſtomed light: <hi>and the Starres of heauen ſhall fall,</hi> that is, ſhall bee ſeene to fall indeede, <hi>and the powers of heauen ſhall bee ſhaken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in earth, trouble in all nations with perplexitie of minde, and great ſorrowes. <hi>Luke.</hi> 21.25.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in the ſea and waters, hideous ſounds and rorings moſt terrible ſhall bee heard. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.25.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in the ayre, there ſhall bee terrible tempeſts. So that heauen and earth ſhall then preach Chriſt to vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to their great horrour, for their long contempt of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, and laſtly beefore his comming, <hi>the heauens ſhall
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:4351:171"/> paſſe away with a noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with heate, and the earth with the works that are therein ſhall be burnt vp.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt ſigne is in his very comming, and this is called by the Euangeliſts <hi>the ſigne of the Sonne of man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 24.29.30.</note> 
                     <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a cloud with power and great glory. Luke.</hi> 21.27. This I take it to bee, the great, glorious and lightſome beames of maieſtie whereby the world ſhall bee renued and enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned immediately before his perſonall appearance, to ſupply the defect of the light of Sunne and Moone, like as wee ſee in Somer in the dawning of the day, certaine beames of the Sunne appeare for a good ſpace of time before the Sunne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in ſight aboue our Horriſon, or ſenſible to our eye: ſo ſhall there bee a glorious euidence of the approching of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, vnto the eyes of all men before they heare his perſonall and bodily preſence beefore them. And thus far ſhall ſuffice for the firſt point that there ſhall be an vniuerſall Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the forme of the generall iudgement. There is no man can well expreſſe the admirable forme of this great Iudgement, yet ſo far as the Lord hath reueled it, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, I ſhall declare it. In the forme three things are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to bee reſpected: Firſt, the preparation vnto the great ſeſsion. Secondly, the proceeding in Iudgment. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the execution of the difinitiue ſentence.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, beefore his comming, preparation ſhall bee made by fire. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3. <hi>A fire ſhall deuoure before him</hi> (as we heare before out of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.10.11.12.) for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth muſt paſſe through a fire: not to conſume them to nothing (for then where ſhould Chriſt appeare in Iudgement, and ſinners muſt bee iudged on the earth, and in the place where they haue ſinned) but to conſume their leproſie and corruption, wherewith the ſinne of man hath infected heauen and earth, that ſo being as gold purified in fire they may ſhine bright, and glorious, and may bee fit to
<pb facs="tcp:4351:172"/> intertaine the maieſtie of this great king at his glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Iudgement, for as the Apoſtle ſaith. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. <hi>It is the figure or forme, not the nature or ſubſtance of the world that paſſeth away.</hi> The ſame is teſtified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo ſhall bee deliuered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God.</hi> So <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.72.28. <hi>The heauens ſhall waxe old, &amp;c. and ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, then ſhall bee the appearing of the glorie of the mightie God, <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. 2.14.</note> &amp; of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhal come from the higheſt heauens, accompanied with an exceeding great hoaſt of mightie Angels, and <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12.22. 1. Cor. 6.1.2.</note> ſoules of righteous men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, then ſhall bee heard the ſound of a trumphet, a wonderful <note n="c" place="margin">The. 4.16.</note> peircing, &amp; long continued ſound, ſummoning all men and Angels vnto Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the good Angels ſhall gather all nations, and bring all vnto the place of Iudgement, all (I ſay) the <note n="d" place="margin">2. Tim. 4.1.</note> liuing and the dead, for the very dead ſhall firſt bee called out of their graues, and they ſhall come clothed with their owne bodies. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. And with them ſhall appeare all that bee aliue changed in a moment in the twinckling of an eye: and corruptible bodies ſhall bee come incorruptible, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhall turne ſpirituall, liuing immediately by the vertue and power of God. And then the bodies of the Saints ſhall bee like the glorious body of Chriſt, ſhining as the Sunne. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. And the wicked ſhall bee full of ſhame and diſhonour. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. The euill Angels alſo, they are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the iudgement of the great <note n="e" place="margin">Iud. 6.</note> day. And then Antichriſt the Sonne of perdition ſhall appeare in his colours, who ſhall be conſumed and waſted continually by the ſpirit of Chriſt, preaching the Goſpell <note n="f" place="margin">Th. 2.7.8.</note> but his finall aboliſhing and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall bee at the glorious comming of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, after all this ſhall Chriſt bee ſet in his throne of iudgement: as the Euangeliſts ſpeake, <hi>Then ſhall hee ſit vpon the throne of his glory. Mat.</hi> 25.31, <hi>and this throne ſhall be like
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:4351:172"/> a flame of fire. Dan.</hi> 7.9. ſo that the wicked ſhall deſire the mountaines to couer them from the ſight of it.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, this done, the Lord ſhall make ſeparation between the Elect and the reprobate: as he doth here on earth in the Church make ſeparation betweene the precious and the vile,<note place="margin">Confer. Mat. 3. &amp; Ier. 15.</note> by the fame of his Goſpell preached: ſo will he by his owne immediate voyce, and miniſtry of his Angels, make a finall ſeparation in that day betweene the one and the other. The ſheepe which heard his voyce and teſtified their faith by their innocency, like lambes they ſhall ſtand on the right hand: They which contrarilie teſtified their vnbeleefe by their laſciuiouſneſſe and luſts like Goates ſhall be ſet on his left hand.<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seauenthly, euery mans particular cauſe ſhall bee tryed beefore this Iudge by the euidence which his workes ſhall giue with him or againſt him. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Wee muſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, that euery man may receiue the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it bee good or euill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the better to aſſure vs of the truth and certaintie of the Lords proceeding &amp; of his particularizing of al things in this action, the holy Ghoſt telleth vs that the Lord hath as it were, bookes of record to manifeſt all and euery work of man: and his bookes bee three in number. Firſt, his booke of prouidence, which is the knowledge of all particular things paſt, preſent, and to come. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.16. Secondly, his booke of iudgement, which is diuided, as it were, into two parts, firſt, his preſcience knowing euery thing far more euidently then wee know any thing recorded in a booke before our eyes: ſecondly, the ſecond part of the booke of iudgement is the conſcience of euery man ſtanding beefore him, which ſhall then bee ſo qualified by the great power of God, that it ſhall bee able to record and teſtifie ſo much of all his particulars as ſhall ſerue to teſtifie his faith and iuſtification by Chriſt, or his moſt iuſt condemnation without Chriſt. The third booke is the booke of life, which is the eternall decree of
<pb facs="tcp:4351:173"/> God concerning the ſaluation of his elect by Chriſt: whoſe names bee ſo written in this booke, that they (being as gods precious pearles) can neuer bee loſt. Of this booke read. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 4.3. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. And of this diſtinction of bookes. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And I ſaw the dead both great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the bookes were opened: and another booke was opened which is the booke of life, and the dead were iudged of thoſe things which were written in the bookes, according to their works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after that mens works are made manifeſt by theſe bookes, then muſt they bee tryed whether they be good or euill: the Gentiles and Iewes that neuer heard of Chriſt, by the Law of nature, which ſhall proue them inexcuſable. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12.16. The reſt that haue heard, ſhall bee tryed by the Law and Goſpell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. The word of God ſhall ſerue as a bill of inditement for the iuſt condemnation of all ſuch as haue contemned the Law &amp; Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.48. for the ſentence of the Iudge in the laſt day of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall iudgement, ſhall bee nothing elſe but a manifeſtation and declaration of the ſentence pronounced and publiſhed before by the miniſtry and preaching of the Goſpell touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iuſtification and condemnation of euery particular perſon.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, after the manifeſtation of all things, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular conſcience ſees his bleſſed iuſtification by Chriſt or his iuſt condemnation by vnbeleefe, and for his woorkes, then the Iudge ſhall proceede to his definitiue ſentence: and this is two-fold.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is pronounced to the Elect in theſe words. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi> This ſentence is full of affection and loue, moſt ſweete and moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: recommending the free grace of God, their election, their adoption, and bleſſedneſſe in Chriſt, and not their workes, for the cauſes of their ſaluation: and then he addeth the euidence of their Faith by the workes of mercy which
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:4351:173"/> they haue done to his members here on earth: <hi>I was hungry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The principall works of men are thoſe which are done to the pore members of Chriſt. Gal. 6.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and yee gaue me to eate. &amp;c.</hi> The anſwere of the Saints, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>when ſaw wee thee hungry, &amp;c.</hi> argues that they were far from vaine glory in their works or ſeeking any iuſtification by them: and Chriſts laſt words to them: <hi>in as much as you did it to the leaſt of theſe my brethren, &amp;c.</hi> giues vs an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument of Gods child: which is, not to loue becauſe wee are loued againe, but to loue for Chriſts ſake, and the liuing members of Chriſt, becauſe wee ſee his picture and image in them renued, this is a ſpeciall grace of God: and of this loue ſpeakes <hi>Dauid.

                  <p>The ſecond ſentence pronounced againſt the reprobate is, <hi>goe yee curſed into hell fire prepared for the Diuell and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for I was hungry and yee gaue me no meate, &amp;c.</hi> in which ſentence are contained a heape of woes, preſent and to come.

                  <p>The ſecond errour is, that the world ſhould haue needed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> any purgation, or ſhould haue waxen old like a garment as now it doth, or that there ſhould haue needed any iudgement, except ſinne had entered into the world, and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the earth at the beginning was ordayned to ſtand for euer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.90. and that there is no more cauſe that men ſhall inhabite it now after the Iudgement, then if men had neuer ſinned, and that this purpoſe of God ſhall ſuſtaine and repaire it for to bee a monument of his owne work for euermore.</p>

For ſo it pleaſed God to entiſe and draw vnto him that infant-church by worldly promiſes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they grew to bee more perfect by the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Dauid.

<pb facs="tcp:4351:178"/> doe, let the Parable of the rich man and <hi>Lazarus</hi> confute them. And ſurely the Prophet doth prophecie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt in this world before the later day, for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before in the ſixt verſe, hee ſpeaketh of his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fleſh and ofspring of <hi>Iſhai</hi> the father of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and of his annointing by the holy Ghoſt, wherby he ſhould rule and gouerne his Church; and immediately after, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth the calling of the Iewes, and their collection from the foure quarters of the world, and that they ſhall <hi>raigne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the children of Ammon,</hi> which they ſhall not after the later day, and therefore that place of Scripture cannot bee applyed fitly to the ſtate of the Elect after the later day. But is an Allegorie of their peace after ther returne, if ſo be they would cleaue to the Meſsias, and not bee Infidels, denying his perſon, and not caring for all his promiſes: otherwiſe for their faith and full confidence in God, and for their affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with Chriſt in the fleſh, they ſhould haue ſeene an end of all hoſtilitie in the world, ſo that no more a man ſhould ſtriue with his brother, nor beaſt with beaſt, nor any of them againſt mankinde, but all ſhould bee obedient to men as to their Lord, which was the eſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe; and this place of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> doth liuely ſet out vnto vs the louing condition of men and beaſts one with other, before the time that the Serpent beguiled our firſt parents.</p>
                  <p>And to returne to your firſt ſpeech in your obiection, that it would bee more comfortable to vs to bee righted in this world, and here to raigne where we haue endured all miſery; I anſwer and ſay, alas, what ioy ſhall ther be to a ſoule which is fetched downe from heauen to dwell in the earth againe. Would it haue beene any comfort for <hi>Ieroboam</hi> after he was king of Iſrael, to haue gone back againe into Egipt, and raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there like a Lord? and whether were it better to bee a king among Angels in heauen, or to bee a commaunder and Lord among beaſts of the earth: Then I will conclude, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> would not let <hi>Lazarus</hi> goe forth of his boſome, into the world againe, no not to preach repentance
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:4351:178"/> to ſinners, then much more ſhall not any of the Saints, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in body or ſoule come againe after the later day to haue their owne particular glory vpon this earth refined.</p>
                  <p>So then it being cleare that wee ſhall goe immediately to heauen after the later day, and not remaine here vpon earth, for which cauſe thoſe which ſhall be then aliue, <hi>ſhall be taken vp into the ayre to meet with Chriſt.</hi> I will conclude, that this place, of which wee neuer heard euill word, ought to bee as the ſtrongeſt motiue, to ſtraine and ſtriue both body and ſoule for the attaining thereof. For if <hi>Dauid</hi> had rather <hi>abide in the courts of the Lords houſe,</hi> which was the temple at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>one day then in any other place a thouſand:</hi> ſurely one houre in heauen ſhall bee better then a thouſand yeares of pleaſure and glory heare vpon the earth. For the ſight of Chriſts glory in infirmitie, I meane, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw him transfigured in the mount: <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. made them to forget themſelues, their wiues, children, meate, drinke, and returne home againe; and to deſire to dwell with Chriſt transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> Much more therfore ſhall the ſight of Chriſt in perfect glory, and when wee alſo ſhall appeare with him in glory, engender in vs ten thouſand times more ioy and delight, then we can haue in earth, except heauen and all the hoſts both of the Trinitie, Angels, and all Saints come downe from heauen for to dwell in the earth, and therefore I firmely beleeue that wee ſhall bee in heauen and not vpon earth after the laſt iudgement.</p>

Now what will a man imagine that God hath treaſured vp for himſelfe in that place where his owne maieſtie dwelleth. The kings of Iſraell, yea all the kings of the earth keepe their owne dwellings repleniſhed withall delight, and there is not in great courts any want of outward glory and magnificence of coſtly garments: of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of meate and drinke, of diuerſitie of wealth and riches, of eminent gifts of wit and ſcience, and all other things: as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid of himſelfe, he forbore nothing whatſoeuer his heart deſired, but gaue his ſoule her ſatisfaction. Much more is it in the Court of the Lord of hoſts, for there hee hath gathered together all heauenly attire, all attendance of Angels, all applauſe of the ſoules of iuſt and perfect men, all ſufficiencie of gifts and knowledge out of all the nations of the earth, all ſoueraigntie to command at an inſtant, and to comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll in the fartheſt parts of the world, ſo that whatſoeuer is iron, braſſe, ſiluer or gold in this world, that is precious pearle in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
                  <p>It was a moſt noble and excellent comfort that in the old Teſtament, it was prophecied that <hi>the Lord would be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one in the middeſt of Ieruſalem: Hoſe.</hi> 11. and that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt deſireth that wee ſhould bee where hee is in the kingdome of his Father. Surely princes bring plenty to their followers, eſpecially great and rich Princes, and therefore the content which ariſeth to the ſeruants of god in this place, muſt needs be infinite and vnſpeakable: for as in the former they were deliuered from all manner of want; ſo in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are ſtored with all manner of plenty that their harts can deſire.

And therefore wee read that as kings are ſo borne and choſen to their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ſo alſo are the inhabitants or kings in heauen, either borne of Chriſtian parents, vnder the couenant of grace, whereby in right of ſpirituall blood they haue direct ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all title to that kingdome of glory; and alſo if they bee not borne vnder the couenant, but of Turks, Iewes, Pagans and Infidels, yet in the eternall councell of God they are to bee drawen beſide the ordinary manner into this regiment, as <hi>Dauid</hi> to bee a king which was the Sonne of a Shepeheard, and as all the kings of Polonia are at this day, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Germanie, and the king of the Romaines by elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuffrage of others; ſo alſo doth the Lord conuert them dayly from Iudaiſme, Paganiſme, heatheniſme, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, papiſme and infidelitie, to bee kings in this kingdome, ſo that herein they may bee no let or hinderance, but that by birth and deſcent being baptiſed, and by conuerſion and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of the loſt multitude, as it were by election, God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth into this glory dayly ſuch as pertaine to euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4351:185"/> alſo is it with the Saints in heauen, for they haue their ſeates whereon they fit as Iudges and kings, iudging the euill An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and thereupon our Sauiour told his Diſciples that they ſhould <hi>ſit on ſeates iudgeing the twelue tribes of Iſraell.</hi> It was not for nothing that there were ſixe ſteps aſcending vp to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> throne, whereby he was eleuated and aduanced aboue the people: ſo likewiſe in token of our eleuation, our manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in heauen are decyphered by thoſe aſcending ſteps.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, kings haue all neceſſaries prouided to their hands, and are not troubled or combred with any thing, but the toiles and labours of their life are diſpatched by other miniſters and perſons: Such alſo is our eſtate in the kingdome of heauen; for we ſhall haue all things prouided for vs by God himſelfe and all his holy Angels, as may appeare by that deſcription of the new <hi>Ieruſalem.

I will giue to him that is a thirſt of the well of the water of life freely.</hi> The well of the water of life is the meanes and prouiſion of immortalitie which is already laid vp in ſtore for the elect, and they ſhall receiue thereof freely like gueſts that are bidden to a banquet. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is it <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. compared to a wedding feaſt where all them that are bidden receiue entertainment at the coſt of other. In this preſent world it is as much as man can compaſſe to get

                  <p>Sixtly, kings are not ſubiect to any comptroll except it bee of almightie God, and ſuch is the eſtate of the Saints in heauen, not onely to liue without rebuke, but to commit nothing worthy blame. There was neuer man in this preſent world but hee receiued checks and reproofes by one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes iuſtly, ſomtimes vniuſtly, for this world is full of the ſtrife of tongues. <hi>Abraham</hi> was reprooued by <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech, Dauid</hi> by <hi>Nathan, Ezekiah</hi> by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> his men and army rayled on by <hi>Rahſaketh,</hi> and therefore how happy ſhall it bee to bee in ſuch a ſtate, where neither a man ſhall bee blamed or bee blameable. For in this kingdome all our thoughts, words and works ſhall bee ſo refined and directed by the immediate preſence of God, that in our ſelues wee ſhall raigne ouer our owne paſsions, according as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. that the Churches children or ſonnes ſhall bee princes in all lands. <hi>Better is a man that ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) then hee that ouerthroweth a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> And therefore this happineſſe which neuer man could attaine vnto in this life, now ſhall hee enioy, for hee ſhall not ſtriue any more againſt the ſpirit, and ſhall not ſay. <hi>The good that I would I doe not, and the euill that I would not that doe I:</hi> but haue in himſelfe a quiet reſolution without all inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance and reſiſtance to follow, beleeue, embrace, and work thoſe things which concerne the onely pleaſure of God, and the pleaſure of God ſhall bee the ioy of himſelfe. So that it is more to raigne ouer himſelfe then ouer all the nations of the earth, for <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> a great king, yet for lack of gouernement became a brute beaſt. <hi>Dauid</hi> for lacke of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement brought a plague vpon the people. <hi>Alexander</hi> for lacke of this temper and rule ouer himſelfe, after hee had (as hee thought) wonne and ouercome all the world, yet fell to deifie himſelfe and would bee called a God, and at laſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſlaine or elſe dyed in his drunkenneſſe. Now ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:4351:186"/> was our eſtate in the beſt, I meane in innocency, that as <hi>Adam</hi> could not containe himſelfe, no more can nor ſhould any of vs, and if in the caſe wee are in, clothed with this ſinfull and corruptible fleſh, wee were in heauen, euen in heauen wee ſhould looſe heauen. But now the Lord hath prouided for vs a more endurable eſtate better then <hi>Adams,</hi> becauſe wee ſhall not looſe our ſelues, and better by dying, then if without death and change wee ſhould goe to heauen; for we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more bee able to ſinne, neuer haue a check by God, man, or Angell, neuer more bee ſorrowfull in our ſelues, becauſe wee are reprooued by and in our owne conſciences, but reſt in our ſelues and without our ſelues like kings againſt whom there is no riſing vp, want, or rebellion.</p>

                     </hi> a place neither in earth, hell or heauen, for then the promiſe of Chriſt was to no effect, in truſt whereof they all died. Their martyrs which were many as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. which for his ſake
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4351:186"/> were killed all the day long, had but a cold pull and dough take, to ſhed their liues for the ſake of the God of Iſraell, if immediately after their death and effuſion of their deareſt blood, they were not aſſured of their reſt in heauen.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſay they place coniectures in ſtead of faith, and their owne opinions in ſtead of true diuinitie.

Now I thinke there cannot bee any reaſonable man ſo minded, for is it likely that Chriſt would equiuocate and diſſemble with the poore man on the Croſſe, and ſay vnto him, <hi>This day thou ſhalt bee with me in Paradiſe;</hi> that is, this day thou ſhalt bee with mee where I am vpon the Croſſe. Had not this beene a cold comfort, or rather a plaine deluſion, if this Paradiſe had beene where Chriſt ſuffered. Nay, rather ſeeing the poore man prayed him <hi>to remember him in his kingdome,</hi> meaning the kingdome of glory and heauen, for he could not meane any thing elſe at that time: I doe firmely beeleeue that the ſame thing which Chriſt called Paradiſe, was no other thing then that which the good theefe called his kingdome, and ſo as Chriſt went the ſame day to his kingdome, he went to the true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, whereof the firſt was but a ſhadow and type: for as there is a great deale of difference betwixt the kingdome of grace and the kingdome of glory; ſo is there betwixt the firſt paradiſe of Eden, and the laſt paradiſe of heauen.</p>

O bleſſed region of ſupernall powers, where the bleſſed Trinitie is beheld of the ſaints face to face, where thoſe heauenly hoaſts with the higheſt note and ſtraine of voyce ceaſe not to ſing <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.</hi> That is a place of pleaſure, where the righteous drinke of the riuer of pleaſure. That is a place of brightneſſe, where the iuſt ſhine like the Sunne in the Firmament. That is a place of gladneſſe, where euerlaſting gladneſſe is put vpon their heads. That is a place of abundance, where nothing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them that ſee him. That is a place of ſweetnes, where the Lord of heauen is ſweete to all. That is a place of peace, where his place is all peace. That is a place of wonders, where all things are admirable. That is a place of ſatietie, where wee ſhall bee ſatisfied, with the appearing of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That is a place of viſion, where wee ſhall ſee the great viſion of all. O ſupernall region, repleniſhed with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of riches, ſtore and content, out of the valley of teares we long for thee, where ſhall bee wiſedome without ignorance, memory &amp; remembrance without forgetfulnes, vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without errour, and reaſon ſhall ſhine for euermore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſcuritie of darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>It is a region wherein the Lord ſhall miniſter to the elect, that is, ſhall ſhew himſelfe ſuch an one as hee is. There ſhall the Lord bee all in all, where the vniuerſalitie of all things together ſhall giue glory to the Creatour, and ioy to the creature. Runne therefore (O my ſoule) and with the eyes of thy deſires through out this region, looke vpon the king of eternall glory, attended by legions of Angels, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with flocks of Saints, hee putteth downe the proud, and lifteth vp the meeke, hee condemneth the Diuels, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth men, ſay vnto him: Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe O Lord, for they ſhall praiſe thee for euer and euer: and ſo far Saint <hi>Bernard:</hi> by which it appeareth that in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4351:187"/> his dayes there was no queſtion of Paradiſe mentioned in the Goſpell, for hee clearely beleeued that it was heauen, which the theefe prayed for, and that which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnder the name of Paradiſe. And therefore if heauen bee Paradiſe a place of pleaſure, wherein God ſhall walke with men without terrour, as hee did with <hi>Adam:</hi> and they ſhall bee reſtored to their perfection and primitiue puritie, and ſuch glorious content as the firſt Paradiſe could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them: then I may ſhut vp this point with that ſaying of our Sauiour in Saint <hi>Iohn. Apo.</hi> 2. <hi>To him which ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſhall be giuen to eate of the tree of life, which is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the paradiſe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, heauen alſo in the Goſpell is called <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, wherein <hi>Lazarus</hi> reſted in happineſſe, while the rich man was tormented in hell. Now herein alſo the nice curioſitie and infidelitie of men appeareth, for that alſo they faine <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome to bee a third place, wherein the Fathers ſate looking for the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light in darkeneſſe, whoſe beſt eſtate was, not to bee tormented: But if a man ſhould aske them whether it be an allegory or noe, I meane, the terme of <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, or whether it bee a plaine ſpeech, without figure; without trope, without queſtion, of the very boſome of <hi>Abraham.</hi> If they ſay this laſt, that it is a plaine ſpeech, then <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was gathered to his fathers did but delude the world, and was not buried in his ſepulcher hee bought of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> or elſe hee roſe againe preſently, like the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her fained aſſumption, and that his boſome muſt be ſo large as may hold all the ſoules of the world. But why doe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute that? they graunt a Trope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome they yeeld ſignifieth the hope that <hi>Abraham</hi> dyed in for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and reſtitution: then belike they reſt in no place, neither in light nor darkneſſe; but onely in hope: To ſalue this they flie to another allegory, and ſay it ſignifieth a place wherein the old Fathers remaine after death till the death of Chriſt: but what phraſe of holy Scripture doth warrant this?
<pb facs="tcp:4351:188"/> wee ought not to take the bare words of interpretours in a point of this moment, and therfore eyther ſhew ſome phraſe of the word to eſtabliſh it, or elſe for euer bee ſilent to think or teach otherwiſe, but that <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, and it is cleare by the 11. Chapter to the Hebrewes, that all the Fathers, martyrs and godly men dead before Chriſt, <hi>which ſubdued kingdomes, quenched the violence of the fire, ſtopped the mouthes of Lyons, and wrought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and obtained the promiſes, are aſcended into glory.</hi> And touching the vſe of this title I will omit it, leauing euery one to the particular application of it to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, I might adde vnto theſe, the great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Lambes mariage, the time of refreſhing and many other ſuch titles; but I ſpare them, and will adde onely this one which is Saint <hi>Pauls.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Life is the thread whereupon all our eſtates depend, for which not onely the reaſonable man laboureth, but alſo the brute beaſts, yea, euery mans bloud, heart, braine, liuer, arteries, ſpirits and veines deſire to retaine life, for by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of life wee mooue, that is, eate, drink, ride, play, labour, runne, loue, hate, deſire, obtaine, and doe all things: and for the life wee beg, craue, ſpend, worke, trauaile, endure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, medicines, ambuſtions, ſearings, ſawings, and many other miſeries. <hi>Et ſi vita tranſitus tantum diligitur, quomodo diligeretur ſi permaneret.</hi> If the life that is tranſitory bee thus much loued, how would it bee loued if it were permanent and conſtant. Firſt, therefore by life we vnderſtand a perfect life without annoyance, wherein the ſoule liueth not onely in a corner of his caſtle, and light ſhineth out but of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or the Sunne ſheweth weakely, but that euery ſence be abſolute the eye to ſee, and not to bee dazeled with any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, the eare to heare, both the loweſt and lowdeſt voyce,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4351:188"/> the heart and affections to deſire, loue, hate, delight, know and poſſeſſe without feare, want, care, ignorance, cumberance, or any interruption: and generally there muſt bee wanting all that wee call the puniſhment of ſinne, for they are parts of death, and therefore enemies to life. But the iuſt muſt liue in moſt reſplendent manner. They muſt not bee tireable with labour, nor weake, nor heauy, nor dull, nor want any part, but life is perfect, and therefore they muſt bee able to leape ouer any wall, to paſſe in at any doore, to ouercome any beaſt or aduerſary, and finally, to ſhew all the ſpirit and noble parts together, and not ſucceſsiuely. And this was it which was ſignified by the Lord. <hi>Reue.</hi> 21.5. <hi>He ſhall wipe away all teares,</hi> euery ſorrow and cauſe of lamentation is a kind of death contrary to the true acception of life, and enuy killeth the bones.</p>
                  <p>An other thing which belongeth to our glorified eſtate is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the perfect knowledge that wee ſhall then haue of the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, for wee now heare of many things, but cannot come to their aſſurance, otherwiſe then by a liuely faith, but then wee ſhall ſee face to face the former parts of God, and know perfectly all thoſe things, whereof wee are now igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. But this limitation that wee muſt not thinke to know the diuinitie in perfection, for that is infinite, and we are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vncapeable of that accompliſhed maieſtie, in ſo large manner as it is in it ſelfe. There is a ſtory of a certaine man which promiſed to tell what God was, and all that euer hee was: another to ſhew him his vanitie, went to the ſea ſide, and digged three ſmall pits along the ſame in his preſence, not telling what was his intention, but onely deſired him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what hee was doing. At laſt they being made, this man that could declare all that the diuinitie was, asked him for what cauſe hee made thoſe three holes or ſmall pits, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued anſwere; I make them ſaid the labourer, to empty all the water of the ſea into theſe three, whereat the great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man laughed, that there ſhould bee ſuch a doult in the world as could imagine ſo impoſsible a thing, and ſhewed
<pb facs="tcp:4351:189"/> him his folly: then ſayd the other, if I bee ſo fooliſh to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to emptie all the water out of the ſea into theſe three pits or holes, how much more fooliſh art thou, to vndertake a demonſtration of the infinite maieſtie of God, which is greater then the ſea, higher then the heauens, broader then from Eaſt to Weſt, and euery way inſearchable. So indeede it is ſufficient that wee ſhall bee filled with the knowledge of God, ſo much as wee are capeable of, and are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, for a barrell cannot containe a tonne, nor an ell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach a mile. The Prophets widdow had all the veſſels ſhee brough filled with oyle, and ſo ſhall wee bee filled with the knowledge of him in his kingdome, for this knowledge. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.3. is life eternall, when there ſhall bee no language, but wee ſhall bee able to interprete it, no reaſon or riddle but wee ſhall be able to open and vnfold it, no queſtion or obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but to anſwere it, no article of religion, but to beleeue &amp; embrace it, no darke ſaying in the holy word of God, but wee ſhall vnderſtand it, and nothing ſtraunge in nature or any naturall thing, but wee ſhall diſcuſſe and declare it, like as <hi>Iotham</hi> could his owne riddle.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I thinke there need not bee any queſtion of this mater, but rather wee ſhould labour to know the meanes of comming to heauen, then trouble our heads about the glory and ioyes wee ſhall receiue there, what a vaine thing is it for a merchant to boaſt what things hee will doe at Ieruſalem
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:4351:189"/> when hee commeth thither, and in the meane time, hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhip nor money, nor knowledge of the way, nor any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary prouiſion to carry him to Ieruſalem: ſo it fareth with them that make theſe queſtions, whom they ſhall know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their old friends and acquaintance? what talke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of worldly paſſed matters?

I will neuer trouble my ſelfe about two things, firſt, about the faſhion, colour and brokenneſſe of my carkeiſe in the graue, without skin, without forme, without life: ſecondly, about the friends and acquaintance I ſhall haue in heauen till I come there: But to ſatisfie this queſtion leaſt any part of heauenly glory ſhould bee omitted, which may bee gathered out of the word of God, therefore I ſay that wee ſhall know one another more inwardly, more outwardly, more truely, and more comfortably then euer wee did in the world, and that I will manifeſt foure wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wee ſhall know God, as hath beene prooued, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> knowledge wee ſhall haue of God, ſhall bee more then all the knowledge that euer wee conceiued of men, ſo then if the ioyes of heauen by the direction of Angels, or through the knowledge of the Goſpell which wee haue attained vnto in this preſent world, and doe carry with vs out of the vvorld, through the goodnes of the holy Ghoſt, do ſhew vnto vs the perſon and things that we neuer ſaw or knew in this life, then I beleeue much more that vve ſhall know againe fathers, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, brethren, ſiſters, vvife, husband, children and friends, vvhom vve did know, and vvith vvhom vvee did conuerſe in this preſent vvorld, for in nothing muſt our knowledge bee empared but bettered in all things, and as ſociety is not comfortable vvithout familiar acquaintance, God forbid that any man ſhould thinke this to bee vvanting in the heauenly eſtate, yea, as there are places in heauen, as vvell as in earth, God hath ſorted and placed kindred and countries together, and this made <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſay ſpeaking of his child. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we ſhall know one another at the laſt day and after the reſurrection, beecauſe vvee ſhall know thoſe holy men, which were neuer knowen to vs in this world, for if Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> did know <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> at the transfiguration of Chriſt, which were dead at the leaſt ſixe hundred yeares before their time, and if the iuſt men which roſe againe at the death and reſurrection of Chriſt and appeared to many in the holy citie after their reſurrection were knowen to their friends and acquaintance, then I conclude that we ſhall know one another, confer one vvith another, and alſo them whom vvee neuer knew in this world, and not by face onely, or in progreſſe of time one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, but alſo by name and ſodainely, ſo as we ſhall be able to ſay, this vvas <hi>Dauid,</hi> this was Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> this was holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> this the widdow of Sareptha, this the good ſonne of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> this my father, this my ſonne, this my vvife, this my paſtour and occaſioner of my ſaluation. And therefore if this delight thee, good Chriſtian reader, then I beſeech thee lay hold on thy ſaluation, and that if thou reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in thy next life thy loſt fame, goods, health, members, dignitie and quietneſſe, doe not thinke that thou ſhalt looſe thy acquaintance for euer and euer, or that heauens ioyes do not ſtand in ſocietie and mutuall conference and comforts one with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, I am confirmed in this opinion, becauſe in the parable of <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the rich man in torments is ſaid to know <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> to know him in hell fire. Now then if the damned know thoſe that are ſaued, and if <hi>Abraham</hi> knew him that was damned, being a Iewe and of his owne poſterity, borne long after his death, (becauſe hee calleth him ſonne) then I know that the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſhall know more, and that they ſhall ſee the wicked plagued before their eyes, to the increaſe of their ioy, for it
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4351:190"/> is a true ſaying, <hi>Et memoria culpa, &amp; viſio infernalis damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum poenae ad laetitiam facient,</hi> that is, both the remembrance of their owne ſinne, and the ſight of the helliſh puniſhment inflicted vpon the damned ſhall helpe forward their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, the end of ſaluation is the perfection of all the ioy that euer entered into the heart of man, and an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> addition of that which neuer entered. <hi>For that,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>which neuer entered into the heart of man hath God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Elect:</hi> but this affection is common in the hearts of men, to deſire the ſight, knowledge and conference with their friends, yea, euery man prayeth at his departure from his acquaintance, <hi>farewell, and if wee meete not on earth, God ſend vs to meete in heauen,</hi> which by a long continued traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the father to the ſonne, by an auncient and true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of their heauenly coniunction, amitie and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to bee renued and continued for euermore, at the renuing and reſurrection of the fleſh. And indeede this word <hi>Life</hi> vvhereupon wee entreat, doth iuſtifie ſo much without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, for is it not true that life is maintained by friends, familiaritie and acquaintance, not onely by encreaſing our new friends, but by keeping our old, and therefore heauen cannot want this happineſſe, but that therein, the mother ſhall know the infant, and child of her wombe, and the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler his maſter vvhich brought him to heauen. Oh, therefore ſit downe vvith thy ſelfe vvhoſoeuer thou be that heareſt or readeſt this, and remember all thy friends that be dead and with the Lord, yea, all the innumerable troupes of iuſt and perfect men, compare them with thoſe that now thou haſt liuing, and compare alſo their inequall eſtates, and thou ſhalt finde, them aboue innumerable, theſe a few, thoſe glorified, theſe humbled, thoſe able to preuaile with God, theſe ſcarce able to get the fauor of men, thoſe paſſed through the worlds dangers, miſeries and enormities without periſhing, theſe ſayling in the middeſt of perils, and therefore ready to bee ouerturned, and in hazard of deſtruction, and in a word,
<pb facs="tcp:4351:191"/> thoſe deſpiſing all earthly kingdomes, becauſe they are enriched with greater matters, theſe carking and caring, moyling and labouring, for a litle corner in this life.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Another propertie of the life to come is the perfection of loue, which ſhall bee in all his ſeruants, for then they ſhall loue God more then themſelues, that is perfectly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, now this loue of God is ſtronger then all the affections of man, for by this loue, they loue one another more then euer, themſelues as much as euer, and God more then themſelues and one another. For this cauſe the loue of God neuer dyeth, for faith and hope decreaſe and decay, and there ſhall bee a time when there ſhall bee no vſe either of faith or hope, but loue ſhall encraſe and continue for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: wherof Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writing vpon the 37.

I ſay a great number expecteth vs which are already ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their owne glory, and are carefull for ours, Oh, to come into their ſight and mutually to embrace them, how great ſhall bee their and our glory both together, what ſhall bee the pleaſure of thoſe celeſtiall kingdomes where the feare of death ceaſeth, and wee aſſured to liue eternally, what is that higheſt and perpetuall felicitie? there are crowned the Godly fellowſhip of the Apoſtles, the great number of Prophets, the innumerable troupes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. There doe virgins triumph, which by the vigour of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4351:192"/> the ſpirit haue gotten victory of all concupiſcence and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in chaſtitie, there ſhall they ſee the mercifull rewarded, who wrought righteouſneſſe by their feeding, clothing and cheriſhing the poore, although for the obeying of Chriſt they haue forſaken their owne patrimonie.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude with the words of Saint <hi>Auſten,</hi> wee can more eaſily tell what is not in heauen, then what is, for wee are not able to tell how great a good God is, and yet we are not permitted to hold our peace, and therefore wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, and yet for ioy wee cannot hold our peace, then whether wee ſpeake or ſay nothing wee ſhall reioyce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. This is their reward to ſee God, to liue with God, to liue of God, to bee of God, to bee in God, to bee for God, which is the cheefeſt good. And where as is the cheefeſt good, there ſhall bee the cheefeſt felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cheefeſt pleaſure, true libertie, perfect charitie, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſecuritie, ſecure eternitie: there is the true reioycing, all knowledge, all beautie, and all bleſſedneſſe; there is peace, pietie, goodneſſe, light, vertue, honeſtie, ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, concord, reſt, praiſe, glory, and life eternall: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, pray gentle Reader, that Chriſt would ſay to thee and mee. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father receiue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, thy Maſters ioy, prepared for you before the worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeede as it is the full promiſe of God it is a gift, but as it is the hire and recompence of a good life it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and euery way it commeth from the free and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gift of God, for if it came any other way, woe were it to vs, which are able to doe ſo little for ſo great a crowne, wee cannot buy it, we cannot ſteale it, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did his fathers bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: but it muſt bee giuen vs, not from or by man, but by the Lord, which giueth plentifully, and caſteth no man in the teeth. And this is a comfort where withall I will end this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb facs="tcp:4351:193"/> for by it I conceiue that the kingdome of heauen ſhall be beſtowed equally, both vpon poore and rich, for it is a gift, and no man can challenge more in that gift then an other, none can bee nearer then other. Euery place of the earth, ſtandeth in equall diſtance from heauen, and euery man and woman are alike capeable of eternall life, the wiſe and fooliſh virgins ſtood in the ſame way and place to expect the ſame bridegroome. Therefore ſeeing all muſt be bound to God for theſe benefits, let vs not iudge any that in our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſeeme to bee far from grace, for the Lords gifts and graces are without repentance, and hee that is able to call them, to graffe them, and to winne them, will cloth their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſoules with comfort. His deſire is to binde men vnto him for it, and therefore let not any man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of their ſaluation, nor enuy them if the Lord call them to heauen at the laſt gaſpe as hee did the good theefe vpon the Croſſe.</p>
